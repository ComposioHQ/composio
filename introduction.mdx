Nango is a single API to interact with all other external APIs. It should be the only API you need to integrate to your app.

# 👩‍💻 Sample code 

Initiate a new OAuth flow from your frontend:

```js
nango.auth('github', 'user123');
```

Get structured objects from external APIs from your backend:

```ts
nango.listRecords<GithubIssue>({
    providerConfigKey: 'github',
    connectionId: 'user123',
    model: 'GithubIssue',
});
```

# Code of Conduct

This project and community (including our Discord server) are dedicated to providing a welcoming, safe, and collaborative environment for everyone.

## Our Pledge
We, as maintainers and contributors, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being kind, respectful, and considerate
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- Public or private harassment, including unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Publishing others' private information ("doxxing") without explicit permission
- Advertising, spam, or off‑topic self‑promotion in project channels
- Any behavior that would be illegal or violates platform Terms of Service

## Discord‑Specific Guidelines
Our Discord is an extension of this community:
- Use appropriate channels; keep topics on‑topic for each channel
- No unsolicited DMs for support or promotion; ask before DMing
- Respect moderators and follow their directions; do not argue moderation in public channels
- Report suspicious links or abuse to moderators immediately
- Follow Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers and Discord moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code applies within all community spaces—GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and our Discord—and when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the maintainers at support@composio.dev or via a direct message to the Discord moderators. All good‑faith reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines
- Correction: Private, written warning and guidance
- Warning: Official warning with consequences for continued behavior
- Temporary Ban: Temporary removal from community spaces
- Permanent Ban: Permanent removal from community spaces

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from common open‑source community standards, including the Contributor Covenant.

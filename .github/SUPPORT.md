# Support

Thanks for using Composio! If you need help, use the following channels:

- Documentation: https://docs.composio.dev
- Discord: https://discord.gg/composio (best for community help and quick questions)
- Email: support@composio.dev (account issues, private questions, or if you can’t use Discord)

Please avoid filing support requests as GitHub issues unless you believe you’ve found a bug. For security issues, do not open a public issue—follow `.github/SECURITY.md`.

## Before asking for help
- Check open and closed issues
- Search the docs and Discord
- Include versions, logs, minimal repro steps, and expected vs. actual behavior

We do our best to respond within 2–3 business days.

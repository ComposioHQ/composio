### Deployment Information[](#deployment-information 'Direct link to Deployment Information')

The Heroku template generates a dedicated Nango Server instance as well as a
separate Postgres database.

Heroku no longer has a free tier, so using this template requires that you set
up your payment information in your Heroku account. This template uses the
lowest tier (\$7/month for the server, \$5/month for the database).

The Nango server will not work right away after you deploy the app on Heroku.
You need to set 2 environment variables in your Heroku app settings:

-   `NANGO_SERVER_URL`: the full URL of your Heroku app (or your custom domain)
-   `NANGO_DATABASE_URL`: the value for the `DATABASE_URL` Heroku config var, to
    which you should append `?sslmode=no-verify` (i.e.
    `<DATABASE_URL>?sslmode=no-verify`)

Finally, you should restart the app and it will work.

You do not need to set the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable.

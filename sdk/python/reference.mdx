### Fetching an Integration

Integrations enable users to connect their accounts with external applications, allowing agents to perform actions on their behalf. To view and manage all active integrations, visit the [Dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/your_apps).

[Follow this guide to create your own integration](introduction/foundations/components/integrations/integration-guide)

Once you create an integration, you can copy the `Integration_ID` from the dashboard.

<CodeGroup> 
``` python Fetching the Integration Object
from composio import Composio

client = Composio() 

Integration_ID = "Your Integration ID"

integration = client.get_integration(Integration_ID)
```
</CodeGroup>


###  Connect an Account using Integration

Integrations are used to connect/authorise user's accounts across tools, enabling agents to execute actions or triggers on those accounts.

Each integration will require some parameters and some actions from account owner to complete the authorisation process.
<Info>Tools like Linear support auth via OAuth & APIKey, but a particular integration created for Linear will always support choosen auth flow</Info>



### Fetch the required params needed to complete the auth

<CodeGroup>
``` python Fetch required parameters for an Integration

integration = client.get_integration(Integration_ID)

print(integration.get_required_variables())
```
</CodeGroup>

### Response from a Linear Integration 
<CodeGroup>
```python Example Response
[
    {
        "name": "api_key",
        "expected_from_customer": true,
        "displayName": "API Key",
        "description": "Your Linear API key for authentication. Obtain it from your Linear settings.",
        "type": "string",
        "required": true
    }
]
```
</CodeGroup>
In response above `api_key` parameter has to be collected from the user. Relevant field information that can be used to display a form in UI are also given.

### Initiate Connection Request

Once you have gathered the necessary authentication parameters, use the `initiate_connection` method to initiate  the connection.

<CodeGroup>
``` python Initiate Connection for an user
params = {"api_key":"1231knakndasn"}

connection_request = integration.initiate_connection(params=params, entity_id = "user_id")

```
</CodeGroup>
To avoid storing a mapping between users and connections in Composio, you may omit the `entity_id` by setting it to `None`. 
Alternatively, if you wish to maintain this association, provide your specific user identifier as the `entity_id` when calling `initiate_connection`.

In the response, you might get `redirect_url` for auth involving OAuth Flows and for them you can redirect the user to that URL to complete the authorisation. 


### Waiting for the user's redirect flow to complete 

<CodeGroup>
``` python Wait for ConnectionRequest to succeed
connected_account = connected_account.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Checking the status of the connected_account

<CodeGroup>
``` python Get current status of a ConnectedAccount
connected_account = composio.get_connected_account(connection_request.id)
```
</CodeGroup>

- Status `Active` means that connection was successful
- Status `Initiated` means that connection process is still underway, occurs when user closes the `redirect flow` before authorising. 

### Executing an Action
To manually execute an action, use the `connected_account.execute_action` method.

<CodeGroup>
```python Execute an action 
action_inputs = {}
action_name = ""

connected_account.execute_action(action_name=action,params=action_inputs)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Fetching Supported Actions using ConnectedAccount

<CodeGroup>
```python List of Supported Actions

actions = connected_account.get_all_actions()

# In case specific schema is needed for input fields of actions array 
# For example openai compatible actions 

# from composio import SchemaFormat
# get_all_actions(SchemaFormat.OPENAI)

# You can also use tags to filter actions
# get_all_actions(tags=[Tag.ASANA_TASKS])  
```
</CodeGroup>

As agents move closer to the user, they need access to the user's data and services to perform tasks with agency. Connecting these agents and applications to third party services means having the manage the complexities of authentication yourself.

## Integrations

An *integration* is a configuration object that defines how an application connects to external service for a user. It encapsulates the authenticaiton credentials, permission scopes and API specification that determine how an AI agent interacts with the external service.


### Using Composio's Client Credentials *(for prototyping)*

It is a development overhead and a burden to manage and create a developer app when making AI Agents for personal use or during prototyping.

To solve for that, you can use Composio's client credentials!

Head over to the [dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/apps) to setup a GitHub
integration for your account following the steps in the video below.

<Step title="Install Composio CLI">
If you haven't already, install the Composio CLI:
```shell CLI
npm install -g composio-core
```
</Step>
<Step title="Authenticate and Connect">
Log in to Composio
```shell CLI
composio login
```
Add GitHub integration

```shell CLI
composio add github
```

Follow the instructions in the CLI to authenticate and connect your GitHub
account.

## Connections and Entities
An *entity* represents a unique user in your application's ecosystem. Think of it as a container that holds all the third-party service connections for a single user. Key points about entities:

For example, if you have a user "Alice" in your application, she would have a single entity ID that links to all her connected services (GitHub, Google Calendar, etc.).

<Tip>Use entity IDs to track and sync a user's connections with your application logic!</Tip>

A *connection* represents an authenticated link between an entity (user) and a specific external service through an integration. When a user authorizes your application to access a service, Composio:


```python Creating a connection for a user {3-5} 
user_id = "alice_id"    # Retrieved through application logic / DB

toolset.get_integration(id=integration.id)
entity = toolset.get_entity(id=user_id)
entity.initiate_connection(app_name=App.GITHUB, use_composio_auth=True)

print(conn_req.redirectUrl) # Emit the redirect URL back to the user
```

During tool calling and execution, specifying the `entity_id` will execute the tool on behalf of the user specified.
```python Executing tool calls on behalf of the user
toolset.handle_tool_calls(
    response=response,
    entity_id=entity.id,
)
```



{/* ### Example Scenario

Let's say you're building an app that helps users manage their tasks across different platforms. Here's how entities and connections work together:

1. A user "Alice" signs up for your app → Composio creates an entity for her
2. Alice connects her GitHub account → Creates a GitHub connection under her entity
3. Alice connects Google Calendar → Creates a Calendar connection under the same entity
4. Your app can now access both services through Alice's connections while Composio handles the auth

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Get Alice's entity
alice_entity = toolset.get_entity(id="alice_123")

# List all of Alice's connections
connections = alice_entity.get_connections()

# Get a specific connection (e.g., GitHub)
github_connection = alice_entity.get_connection(app=App.GITHUB)
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Get Alice's entity
const aliceEntity = await toolset.client.getEntity("alice_123");

// List all of Alice's connections
const connections = await aliceEntity.getConnections();

// Get a specific connection (e.g., GitHub)
const githubConnection = await aliceEntity.getConnection({ appName: "github" });
```
</CodeGroup> */}

<Note>
The entity ID can be any string that uniquely identifies a user in your system. If not specified, Composio uses "default" as the entity ID.

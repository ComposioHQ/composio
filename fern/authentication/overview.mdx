**Composio Auth** simplifies integrating user-authorized actions into your app. It securely manages OAuth flows, handles token storage, and ensures actions are executed with the correct user's credentials.

Depending on the app, your users can authenticate and authorize using OAuth2 or API Keys.

## About authentication and authorization

**Authentication** means checking that a user is who they say they are. This is about establishing WHO the user is. 


<Accordion title="Authentication Example">
  For example, when a user connects their Gmail account to your app, Composio Auth guides the user through Google's OAuth login. The user securely proves their identity to Google, and Composio securely stores the resulting access token, confirming the user's identity without you handling sensitive credentials.
  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
      title 1. Authentication - Establishing User Identity
      actor User
      participant App as Your App
      participant Composio as Composio Auth
      participant Google as Google
      
      User->>App: Connect Gmail account
      App->>Composio: Initiate authentication
      Composio->>Google: Redirect to OAuth login
      User->>Google: Login & grant permissions
      Note over User,Google: User specifies which scopes to allow
      Google->>Composio: Provide tokens with granted scopes
      Composio->>Composio: Securely store tokens & scopes
      Composio->>App: Connection established  
  ```
</Accordion>

**Authorization** means checking what resources a user can access. This is about controlling WHAT the authenticated user can do.

<Accordion title="Authorization Example">
  Continuing the Gmail example, authorization happens when your app attempts to access a user's inbox. Composio manages the permissions (scopes) your app requested during authentication, ensuring your app can only perform authorized actions, like reading emails or managing calendar events, based on the user-granted permissions.

  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
      title 2. Authorization - Controlling Access to Resources
      participant App as Your App
      participant Composio as Composio Auth
      participant Google as Gmail API
      
      App->>Composio: Request to read emails
      Composio->>Composio: Check if "gmail.read" scope was granted
      
      alt Authorized (Scope Granted)
          Composio->>Google: Call API with token
          Google->>Composio: Return email data
          Composio->>App: Deliver data
      else Unauthorized (Scope Not Granted)
          Composio->>App: Error: Insufficient permissions
      end
  ```
</Accordion>


### Authentication Modes Overview
Composio Auth supports multiple authentication modes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth 2.0">
    OAuth 2.0 allows users to securely grant limited permissions to your app for accessing their data on third-party services without sharing actual login credentials.

    Composio Auth streamlines OAuth by managing user authorization, token handling, secure storage, and token refreshing.

    **OAuth 2.0 Flow:**
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        actor User
        participant Client
        participant AuthServer
        participant API
        
        User->>Client: 1. Start login
        Client->>AuthServer: 2. Request authorization
        AuthServer->>User: 3. Prompt for login
        User->>AuthServer: 4. Provide credentials
        AuthServer->>Client: 5. Authorization code
        Client->>AuthServer: 6. Exchange code + client secret
        AuthServer->>Client: 7. Access & refresh tokens
        Client->>API: 8. Request with access token
        API->>Client: 9. Return resource
    ```

    <Note>
    OAuth uses **Scopes** to define the exact permissions your app needs (e.g., `mail.read` for Gmail). Composio helps ensure secure, precise configuration of scopes.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Key">
    API Keys are simple credentials used to directly access services, usually with broad access privileges.

    Composio securely stores API keys, automatically applying them to API requests, providing secure yet straightforward access.

    **API Key Flow:**
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        actor Developer
        participant Service
        participant Client
        participant API
        
        Developer->>Service: 1. Register application
        Service->>Developer: 2. Generate API key
        Developer->>Client: 3. Configure with key
        Client->>API: 4. Request with API key
        API->>API: 5. Validate key
        API->>Client: 6. Return resource
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bearer Token">
    Bearer Tokens are credentials sent in HTTP headers to securely access protected resources without needing underlying user credentials.

    Composio securely manages Bearer Tokens, embedding them in API requests automatically, simplifying secure token handling.

    **Bearer Token Flow:**
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Client
        participant AuthServer
        participant API
        
        Client->>AuthServer: 1. Authentication request
        AuthServer->>Client: 2. Issue bearer token
        Client->>API: 3. Request with "Authorization: Bearer [token]"
        API->>API: 4. Validate token
        API->>Client: 5. Return resource
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Basic Authentication">
    Basic Authentication encodes and sends user credentials (username and password) with each request.

    Composio securely encodes and handles these credentials, managing headers securely, ensuring sensitive data protection.

    **Basic Authentication Flow:**
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        actor User
        participant Client
        participant API
        
        User->>Client: 1. Enter username/password
        Client->>Client: 2. Encode as Base64(username:password)
        Client->>API: 3. Send "Authorization: Basic [encoded]"
        API->>API: 4. Decode and validate
        API->>Client: 5. Return resource
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="JSON Web Token (JWT)">
    JWT is a compact, secure method for encoding user information, claims, and permissions for safe transmission between systems.

    Composio manages JWT lifecycle, including creation, validation, verification of signatures, expiration handling, and secure storage.

    **JWT Flow:**
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Client
        participant AuthServer
        participant API
        
        Client->>AuthServer: 1. Authentication request
        AuthServer->>AuthServer: 2. Generate JWT (header.payload.signature)
        AuthServer->>Client: 3. Return JWT
        Client->>API: 4. Request with JWT
        API->>API: 5. Verify signature and claims
        API->>Client: 6. Return resource
    ```
  </Accordion>

# Fern Documentation Guide

This directory contains all the relevant files and code for the documentation.
The product being used here is Fern.
The documentation is written in `.mdx` files and `fern` converts the `.mdx` files into a fullstack website.

The documentation is for "Composio", an integration and skills platform for AI agents and workflows.

## Common `fern` commands

- `fern docs dev`: Starts the local server (attempting to) rendering the docs at localhost:3000
- `fern docs broken-links`: Finds broken links and returns the location of each of the broken link.
- `fern generate --docs --preview`: Generates and uploads the documentation at a preview link. Returns the link.
- `fern --help`: For viewing more `fern` commands.

## Common make commands

- `make docs`: Comprehensive command that generates all API documentation and then starts the documentation server. This is essentially a shortcut for running `make sdk-generate` followed by `make docs-dev`.

- `make sdk-generate`: Generates API documentation for both Python and JavaScript SDKs. It runs a Python script to process the Python SDK and uses TypeDoc to generate markdown documentation for the JavaScript SDK. The output is saved to the `sdk/` directory.

- `make tools-generate`: Generates documentation for all Composio tools by running the Python generator script located in `generators/tool_doc_generator/main.py`. This script uses 10 worker threads to speed up the generation process.

- `make docs-generate`: Runs both `sdk-generate` and `tools-generate` commands to create a complete set of documentation for both SDKs and tools.

- `make docs-dev`: Starts the documentation development server using Fern. This allows you to preview the documentation locally.

## Guidelines

- Generally, you will be asked to make minor edits to the documentation as well as the code snippets in the documentation. Before any changes, you should read the file to understand what that page wants to explain to the user and better understand the language used and the depth of information conveyed.

- Always rely on the side of caution and revert back and ask me questions to better understand the concept before making any edits or changes that you don't fully understand yet. Think like Feynman - can you fully understand and explain the concept to yourself?

- Before making edits, make sure to look through all the files that are actually will be rendered in the documentation in docs.yml.

- After every change in the documentation, you should run `fern docs dev` and show me the changes.

- After every task, make sure you update `fern/.claude/docs-notes.md` is where you will keep a track of all the gotchas and understandings about the product, Composio as you work through the docs. This file should be read before proceeding on a task and updated on every task completion.

## GitHub PR Process

- Create a new branch with descriptive name: `git checkout -b [username]/[feature-description]`
- Make changes and commit them: `git add [files]` and `git commit -m "[type]: [message]"`
- Push branch to remote: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
- Create PR using GitHub CLI: 
  ```bash
  gh pr create --title "[type]: [title]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

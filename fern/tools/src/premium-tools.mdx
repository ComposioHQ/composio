This is a quick overview of premium tools, what they are, how they are priced, what limits they have and such.


## What are premium tools?

Premium tools are essential tool calls that cost us more to run, normally paying for more premium services or longer running tasks.

Think something like `E2B` or `Firecrawl`, these are not really comparable to a `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` call.

These types of tools are separated out so we can pricing both of them competitively.

This is the current list of premium tools, more will be added over time and this list might change in the future.

- [Code Interpreter (E2B)](/tools/codeinterpreter)

- [Exa](/tools/exa)
- [SerpAPI](/tools/serpapi)


## How are premium tools priced?

As a rough guide, they are priced at 3x the cost of a standard tool call — the specifics depends on your plan and the tool.

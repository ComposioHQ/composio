## Schema Processing and Preprocessing
There may be scenarios where you want to control how the LLM calls a tool and how Composio executes it.
You may want to remove some parameters from the schema, inject some values into the tool call or process the response from the tool call.

{/* In many scenarios, the default schemas, inputs, or outputs of tools may benefit from additional processing. This refinement can significantly improve the reliability and performance of your LLM applications. */}
Let's take `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` as an example. Below is the schema.
{/*  */}

<Accordion title='`GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` Schema'>

```python Python maxLines=24 focus {10-23}
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, App, Action

load_dotenv()

client = OpenAI()
toolset = ComposioToolSet()

send_email_tool = toolset.get_tools(
    [Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL], check_connected_accounts=False
)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a head of AGI at OpenAI."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Send an email to Sam Altman in one sentence that AGI is coming 5 years earlier.",
        },
    ],
    tools=send_email_tool,
)
```

This emits a tool call to `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` from the LLM. Here are the arguments for it.
```json GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL
{
    "user_id": "me",
	"recipient_email": "sam.altman@openai.com",
	"subject": "Urgent Update on AGI Timeline",
	"body": "AGI is projected to arrive 5 years earlier than anticipated."
}
```

Since we didn't provide the `recipient_email` anywhere, the LLM hallucinated something plausible but **wrong nonetheless**.

Morever if you're building a system in which you're already inferring a parameters, you don't need the LLM to tell you the parameter, you can inject it yourself!

This is where tool processing comes into play!

<Card title="Schema Processing" href="#schema-processing" icon="code">
    Handler to modify the tool schema, description, parameters before sending to an LLM.
</Card>

<Card title="Preprocessing" href="#preprocessing" icon="arrow-right">
    Handler to modify or inject parameters to a tool call before it is executed.
</Card>

{/* <Card title="Postprocessing" href="#postprocessing" icon="arrow-left">
  Transforms the OUTPUTS from the tool AFTER execution, but BEFORE returning to the LLM
</Card> */}

<Tip>
Developers looking to improve agent reliability should analyze both the schema and outputs of tools, then use these processors to make interactions more deterministic where needed.
</Tip>

### Schema Processing
Say your system already infers the `recipient_email` parameter and you don't want to send an`attachment`.
You wouldn't want the LLM to generate it in the tool call.
You can simply modify the schema processor to do so:

```python {8}
def schema_processor(schema: dict) -> dict:
    del schema["recipient_email"]
    del schema["attachment"]

processed_send_email_tool = toolset.get_tools(
    actions=[Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL],
    processors={
        "schema": {Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL: gmail_schema_processor},
    },
)
```
This would result in the `recipient_email` and `attachement` parameters being deleted so the LLM doesn't generate it.

### Preprocessing
But you still need to pass `recipient_email` to the tool execution so that `handle_tool_calls` can successfully send the email.

```python {9}
def gmail_preprocessor(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    inputs["recipient_email"] = "sam@openai.com"
    return inputs

processed_send_email_tool = toolset.get_tools(
    actions=[Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL],
    processors={
        "schema": {Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL: gmail_schema_processor},
        "pre": {Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL: gmail_preprocessor},
    },
)
```

<Tip>To avoid confusion between schema and preprocessing, think of schema processing as you changing the tool's definition and preprocessing as a way to process the parameters before the tool is executed!</Tip>

### Putting it all together
```python maxLines=32 {2}
def gmail_preprocessor(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    inputs["recipient_email"] = "sama@composio.dev"  # Change to an email you can access to test!
    return inputs


def gmail_schema_processor(schema: dict) -> dict:
    del schema["recipient_email"]
    return schema


processed_send_email_tool = toolset.get_tools(
    actions=[Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL],
    processors={
        "schema": {Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL: gmail_schema_processor},
        "pre": {Action.GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL: gmail_preprocessor},
    },
    check_connected_accounts=False,
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are head of AGI at OpenAI."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Send an email to Sam Altman in one sentence that AGI is coming 5 years earlier.",
        },
    ],
    tools=processed_send_email_tool,
)

exec_response = toolset.handle_tool_calls(response)
```

{/* TODO: Add sequence diagram showing how schema processing fits into the tool calling workflow, illustrating the flow: LLM -> Modified Schema (with removed fields) -> Tool Call Generation */}

## Postprocessing
Once a tool call has been executed, the response is sent back to the LLM.
However many APIs tend to return lots of data in their responses, making agentic flows unstable and eating up tokens.

<Tip>We'll deconstruct the working behind `handle_tool_calls` by using `execute_action` to directly call the GMAIL_FETCH_EMAILS tool.</Tip>

```python {12-13}
import tiktoken
from composio_openai import ComposioToolset, Action

def num_tokens_from_string(string: str, encoding_name: str) -> int:
    encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)
    num_tokens = len(encoding.encode(string))
    return num_tokens

encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4o-mini")
toolset = ComposioToolset()

emails = toolset.execute_action(Action.GMAIL_FETCH_EMAILS, {})
print(num_tokens_from_string(str(emails), encoding.name))
```
```
>>291344
```
<Error>This is already more than twice the context length of `gpt-4o-mini` (128k tokens)!</Error>

*This is where postprocessing comes in. It lets you filter out what information from the tool execution needs to be sent to the LLM.*

{/* TODO: Add sequence diagram showing postprocessing workflow: API Response (full data) -> Postprocessor (filtering data) -> LLM (simplified response) */}

Say we only need the subject of the emails and the sender, for that we can create a postprocessor as follows:
```python
def gmail_postprocessor(result: dict) -> dict:
    processed_result = result.copy()
    processed_response = []
    for email in result["data"]["messages"]:
        processed_response.append(
            {
                "subject": email["subject"],
                "sender": email["sender"],
            }
        )
    processed_result["data"] = processed_response
    return processed_result

processed_emails = gmail_postprocessor(emails)
print(num_tokens_from_string(str(processed_emails), encoding.name))
```
This gives us a more digestable response for the LLMs!
```

You have received two emails related to AGI:

1. **Email from gdb@composio.dev**  
   - Subject: Update on AGI Development  

2. **Email from Cerebral Valley**  
   - Subject: AGI, Inc. - from MultiOn’s Div Garg ❇️  

Would you like to take any specific actions regarding these emails?
```

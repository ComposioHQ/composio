## Fetching tools
While you can find and specify tools from the [dashboard](https://app.composio.dev), Composio also offers programmatic methods to retrieve tools for your LLM applications. This gives you greater flexibility when building dynamic systems.


### Specifying `apps` and `tags`
You can also retrieve tools by specifying apps and tags, allowing for more targeted tool selection based on your specific needs. This approach helps you filter the available tools to only those relevant to your application.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, Action, App
toolset = ComposioToolSet()

tools = toolset.get_tools(
    apps=[App.JIRA],
    tags=["Issues"]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet();

const tools = await toolset.getTools({
  apps: ["JIRA"],
  tags: ["Issues"]
});
```
</CodeGroup>


When working with tools from specific apps, consider the number of tools from specific apps loaded into your LLMs context window.

<Warning>When fetching by specifying the `App`, the Toolset returns only the tools with an `important` tag and not all the tools!</Warning>

### Use-case search (experimental)

Finding tools based on what you're trying to accomplish is often the most intuitive approach.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Search with code">

```python
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet

toolset = ComposioToolSet()
query = "make a notion page"

actions = toolset.find_actions_by_use_case(
    use_case=query,
    # advanced=True,    # Enable this for complex queries requiring multiple tools
)
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Search with CLI">

```bash
composio actions --use-case 'create a page' --apps notion
Here are the actions for the app:

NOTION_CREATE_NOTION_PAGE
NOTION_CREATE_COMMENT
NOTION_CREATE_DATABASE
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


<Tip>Use the `advanced` flag when you need to retrieve multiple tools to use together in a chain</Tip>

## Using tools directly
It's possible to use custom logic to execute the tools instead of relying on `handle_tool_calls`.
The `params` parameter expects all the valid parameters for the tool you want to execute.

<Tip>You can view the valid parameters for a tool from the [dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/)!</Tip>

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, App, Action

toolset = ComposioToolSet()
toolset.execute_action(action=Action.GOOGLECALENDAR_LIST_CALENDARS, params={})
```

### Using custom auth
If you wish to manage your own authentication from another provider you can add the auth parameters for any app as well!

```python {5-14}
from composio import ComposioToolSet, App

toolset = ComposioToolSet()

toolset.add_auth(
    app=App.GITHUB,
    parameters=[
        dict(
            name="Authorization",
            in_="header",
            value="Bearer gho_",
        )
    ],
)

toolset.execute_action(
    action="GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER",
    params={"owner": "composiohq", "repo": "composio"},
)
```

{/* popup intercom if user is here */}

## Inspect Tool Schemas (Researchers!)
You might want to inspect the tool schemas of your custom tools or Composio tools during experimentation.
By setting `check_connected_accounts` to `False` you can bypass the authentication check in place for ensuring safe execution of tools!

```python {5-7}
from composio import ComposioToolSet, App

toolset = ComposioToolSet()

schemas = toolset.get_action_schemas(
    actions=[Action.GOOGLECALENDAR_LIST_CALENDARS], check_connected_accounts=False
)
```

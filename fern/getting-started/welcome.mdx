Our next generation of SDK are now live. Try them out now!

Composio is an integration and tooling platform built for AI agents and LLM applications that lets you:
- Add tool-use capabilities to your AI agent from [300+ apps](/tools/).
- Give agents [authenticated access to tools](/auth/introduction).
- [Listen and trigger](/triggers/using-triggers) agents and workflows from external events (e.g., new Slack message, GitHub issue).
- [Customize tools](/tool-calling/customizing-tools) for proprietary APIs or specific functions.
- Seamlessly integrate tool-calling into frameworks like OpenAI Agents, Vercel AI, LangChain, etc.
- Refine tool interactions with [input/output processing](/tool-calling/processing-tools) for greater reliability.

You get to connect your AI agents faster without wrestling with individual API integrations and managing their authentication or converting them into LLM tool calls.

We also optimise the tool calls for you for maximum accuracy, free of cost! 😉

## Getting started
The fastest way to give your agent tools is with Composio — often with **zero setup** needed on your part. Just:

1.  **Install the core SDK** (and a framework helper if needed):
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Python
    pip install composio_core composio_openai # Example for OpenAI
    ```

    ```bash TypeScript
    npm install composio-core
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
2.  **Login and get your API key**:
    ```bash
    composio login
    ```
    *(Ensure `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` is set as an environment variable)*
3.  **Connect your first app** (e.g., GitHub):
    ```bash
    composio add github
    ```

...and you're ready to integrate tools. Here's what you can do next:
- Head to the [quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) guide to learn more.
- Browse our [tools](/tools) to see what you can integrate with.

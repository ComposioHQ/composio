After a few months of development, we're excited to release the v3 overhaul of the Composio SDK and APIs! ❤️

The new API is more intuitive to use, more stable, scalable and the SDKs built on top of it are more ergonomic, feature complete.


## What's new?
This major release introduces a new API and SDKs for both TypeScript and Python.


## Why a new version?
In the last few months, we noticed an immediate uptick in usage across the board; the APIs as well as the SDKs. Through the feedback from our users and community, we realised a ton of improvements; namely: needed to be made to the SDKs and APIs as well such as a more intuitive nomenclature, more type-safety and a much better developer experience.

- More intuitive and consistent nomenclature
- Better support for LLM and agentic frameworks like OpenAI, Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI Agents etc.

Pretty soon into internalising this feedback, we realised that the best way to make these improvements was to start from scratch.

## Nomenclature

We have updated several key terms in the SDK and API to make them more intuitive and consistent. The table below summarizes the changes:

| Old Term    | New Term           | Meaning                                                                |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Actions     | Tools              | "Tools" are individual operations or capabilities that can be performed by an LLM agent.|
| Apps        | Toolkits           | A "toolkit" is a collection of tools grouped under a single app. |
| Integration | Auth Config        | Each toolkit has it's own "auth config" which contains the appropriate developer credentials and app level configurations like scopes, API endpoints, etc. |
| Connection  | Connected accounts | "Connected accounts" represent user-linked accounts to a toolkit. |
| Entity ID   | User ID            | The ID of the user that is performing the action. Can be UUID/email. |
| Trigger     | Trigger            | A trigger is an event that can be subscribed to. |
| Toolsets    | Providers          | A "provider" is any LLM/agent framework that can be used with Composio to create agents. |

## Switch to nano IDs from UUIDs
Throughout the product, we've made the switch to using nano IDs instead of UUIDs.

**Why?**
- UUIDs are very long, not human readable.
- Harder to copy in a single double-click.
- Nano IDs let us disambiguate between different types of IDs.

| Feature           | Nano ID Prefix | Example            |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Connected Account | `ca_`          | `ca_8x9w2l3k5m`    |
| Auth Config       | `ac_`          | `ac_1234567890`    |
| Trigger           | `ti_`          | `ti_So9EQf8XnAcy`  |

> **Note:** Nano IDs are short, unique, and prefixed to indicate the resource type.

## What happens to old APIs?
We've managed to re-route all the old APIs to the new ones.

This means that you can continue to use the old APIs, but with some changes.

- Switch to nano IDs from UUIDs.
- [ ] what other changes

## SDKs
You can upgrade to the latest version of the SDKs by running the respective install command:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
pip install -U composio
```
```typescript TypeScript
npm install @composio/core@next
```
</CodeGroup>

Both the SDKs now follow proper namespacing for each concept.

### Scoping to `user_id`
The concept of `entity_id` is now expanded to that of `user_id`.

Most every query is now scoped to a user ID. Fetching tools, initiating connections, executing tools etc, all require a user ID.

This is to verbosely specify the user of your app for which the action is being performed. In case where it is possible for a user to have multiple accounts (think work / personal Gmail connections), a more verbose *connected account ID* can be used.


### Deprecating ToolSets for [Providers](/get-started/providers)
In this current version, we deprecate the concept of "toolsets" and replace it with "providers".

With providers, Composio aims to standardize the mess of writing tools in different frameworks more deeply.

Previously, one had to always import and use a specific framework's `ComposioToolSet` class.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_tools.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={3}
  title="Python (old)"
/>

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_tools.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={3}
  title="TypeScript (old)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

The structure of the SDK is now changed to be more framework agnostic.

**The SDK also ships with OpenAI provider out of the box.**

You can use the same tools across any framework with our unified interface, or create custom toolsets for frameworks we don't support yet.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/providers.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={7}
  title="Python (new)"
/>

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/providers.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={6}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>


Read more about providers [here](/get-started/providers) and get the full list of providers [here](/providers).

### Fetching and filtering tools
Previously, fetching the tools let you filter them by;
- Apps
- Actions names (tool names)
- Tags

You could also specify an important flag to get the `important` tools.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_tools.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={11}
  title="Python (old)"
/>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_tools.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={11}
  title="TypeScript (old)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

However, you can now filter them by toolkits, tool slugs, set a `limit` and a search query as well.

There is no `important` flag, instead the tools are returned in the order of importance.

<Note>Since a `user_id` is explicitly required, the `check_connected_accounts` flag is not required anymore.</Note>

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_tools.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={17}
  title="Python (new)"
/>

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_tools.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={25}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

### Fetching raw tool data
To examine the raw schema definitition of a tool to understand the input/output parameters or to build custom logic around tool definitions, you can use the following methods.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/python/raw_tools.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={11}
  title="Python (new)"
/>

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/typescript/raw_tools.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={11}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

### Executing tools
Executing tools remains largely the same. `user_id` is now explicitly required.

For agentic frameworks, the tool object being emitted from `tools.get` is now the respective framework's tool object. Hence, the tool call execution is handled by the agentic framework.

<Note>
For non-agentic frameworks, Composio provides a helper function to execute the tool calls.
</Note>


<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_execute_tools.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={17}
  title="Python v3"
  highlightStart={16}
  highlightEnd={16}
/>

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_execute_tools.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={30}
  title="TypeScript v3"
  highlightStart={27}
  highlightEnd={27}
/>
</CodeGroup>

For more information on executing tools for different frameworks, please refer to [Deprecating ToolSets for Providers](#deprecating-toolsets-for-providers)

### Tool Modifiers (formerly Tool Processors)
Tool processors are now called *tool modifiers* and now have better developer experience as well as being implemented in TypeScript. Previously, tool processors were only in the Python SDK.

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_tool_modifiers.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={23}
  title="Python (old)"
/>

| Old   | New   |
|------------|-----------------|
| `pre` processor        | `beforeExecute` modifier   |
| `post` processor       | `afterExecute` modifier    |
| `schema` processor     | `schema` modifier          |


Currently, the modifiers leverage the power of the respective language to provide a more natural developer experience.

While previously, tool processors could be applied during SDK initialisation, fetching tools and even executing tools, we've reworked them such that;
- For Chat Completion providers, modifiers are specified and applied while **executing tools**
- For Agentic frameworks, modifiers are specified and applied while **fetching tools**

#### [Schema Modifiers](/docs/modifiers/schema-modifiers)
Following example shows schema modifier. This is applicable across all providers.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python (new)

```
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/tool_modifiers.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={20}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

#### [Before Modifiers](/docs/modifiers/before-execution)
Following example shows creating and using a before modifier for a Chat Completion provider. For agentic frameworks, view the full before modifier documentation [here](/docs/modifiers/before-execution).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python (new)

```
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/tool_modifiers.ts"
  startLine={54}
  endLine={70}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

#### [After Modifiers](/docs/modifiers/after-execution)
Following example shows creating and using an after modifier for a Chat Completion provider. For agentic frameworks, view the full after modifier documentation [here](/docs/modifiers/after-execution).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python (new)

```
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/tool_modifiers.ts"
  startLine={71}
  endLine={89}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

### Custom Tools
The SDK still supports custom tools. [Defining tools from your methods](/docs/custom-tools#creating-a-custom-tool) is still possible and we recommend checking out the documentation [here](/docs/custom-tools#creating-a-custom-tool) for more information.

Due to the change in the nature of SDK, creating custom tools that use Composio's managed authentication is slightly different. In the older SDK, you could create a custom tool like follows:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_custom_tools.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={39}
  highlightStart={14}
  highlightEnd={17}
  title="Python (old)"
/>

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_custom_tools.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={39}
  highlightStart={16}
  highlightEnd={20}
  title="TypeScript (old)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

The *execute tool request* method handles injecting the appropriate base URL and auth credentials for the tool.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_custom_tools.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={39}
  highlightStart={22}
  highlightEnd={22}
  title="Python (new)"
/>

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_custom_tools.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={39}
  highlightStart={17}
  highlightEnd={17}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>


For more information, like executing custom tools, defining custom headers, query parameters, etc, please refer to the [Custom Tools](/docs/custom-tools) documentation.

### Auth configs (formerly integrations)
Integrations are now called *auth configs*. While the name has changed, the concept remains largely the same.

Auth configs store the configuration required for someone to authenticate with a given toolkit; like OAuth developer credentials, configurable base URLs, scopes etc.

Instead of UUIDs, auth configs now use a `nano_id` instead.


| Old (UUID) Example                | New (Nano ID) Example   |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `b7a9c1e2-3f4d-4a6b-8c2e-1d2f3a4b5c6d` | `ac_8x9w2l3k5m`           |


The nano IDs for the auth configs, we recommend you store in a database such that they can be used to connect users to the appropriate auth config.

For most cases, you would use the dashboard to create auth configs and the process remains the same. Read more [on creating auth configs](/docs/authenticating-tools#creating-an-auth-config) and on [customizing the auth config](/docs/custom-auth-configs).

Programmatically creating auth configs in the old SDK:
<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_auth_config.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={15}
  title="Python (old)"
/>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_auth_config.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={15}
  title="TypeScript (old)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

Programmatically creating auth configs in the new SDK:
<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_auth_config.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={15}
  title="Python (new)"
/>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_auth_config.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={15}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

For using your own auth credentials etc, please refer to the [Programmatic Auth Configs](/programmatic-auth-configs#using-custom-auth) documentation.

<Note>The callback URL for creating custom OAuth configs is now `https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3/toolkits/callback` previously it was `https://backend.composio.dev/api/v1/auth-apps/add`</Note>


### Connected accounts / User IDs
The major change in how connected accounts and user IDs work is that user IDs are a much more surfaced concept as compared to entities previously.

We've also simplified the process of connecting a user to a toolkit. Instead of having different ways and params to initiate a connection, the SDK and API both require only a `user_id` and `auth_config_id` to initiate a connection.

This is more explicit and plays well with the fact that developers may have multiple auth configs for a given toolkit.

Instead of UUIDs, connected accounts now use a `nano_id` instead.

| Old (UUID) Example                | New (Nano ID) Example   |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `b7a9c1e2-3f4d-4a6b-8c2e-1d2f3a4b5c6d` | `ca_8x9w2l3k5m`           |

Earlier you might be initiating a connection like this:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_connected_acc.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={30}
  highlightStart={11}
  highlightEnd={16}
  title="Python (old)"
/>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/old_connected_acc.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={30}
  highlightStart={8}
  highlightEnd={13}
  title="TypeScript (old)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

The current process of initiating a connection is as follows:
<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_connected_acc.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={15}
  highlightStart={8}
  highlightEnd={11}
  title="Python (new)"
/>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/migration/new_connected_acc.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={15}
  highlightStart={8}
  highlightEnd={11}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

### Triggers
Composio still supports listening to events from apps using triggers through Websockets and Webhooks.

#### Creating triggers
The process for creating triggers and specifying their configuration has been redesigned to be clearer and more intuitive.

Some triggers require configuration to be specified, for example, the repository name for some GitHub triggers, channel name for Slack triggers, etc.
You can view the configuration for a trigger as follows:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/typescript/triggers.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={27}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

You can then create the trigger with the appropriate configuration.
- [ ] User IDs to be used here.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/typescript/triggers.ts"
  startLine={28}
  endLine={40}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>

#### Enabling/Disabling triggers
You can enable or disable triggers either through the SDK or via the dashboard. The process for managing triggers in the dashboard remains unchanged.

Managing triggers with the SDK:
<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/typescript/triggers.ts"
  startLine={55}
  endLine={56}
  title="TypeScript (new)"
/>
</CodeGroup>


#### Listening to triggers
The recommended way to listen to triggers is through webhooks. Following are example routes for Next.js and FastAPI.

For development, you can also [listen to triggers through the SDK](/docs/using-triggers#subscribing-to-triggers-using-the-sdk-for-development).

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/typescript/trigger-webhook.ts"
  title="app/api/webhook/route.ts (Next.js)"
/>
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/python/trigger-webhook.py"
  title="app/route.py (FastAPI)"
/>
</CodeGroup>


## 🚧 Coming Soon
### Local tools
Previously, the Python SDK had a concept of *[local tools](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/tree/master/python/composio/tools/local)*. These were tools that were defined in the SDK and consisted local shell and code related tools like; "clipboard", "sqltool", "shelltool" etc.

This feature is a work in progress for both the Python and TypeScript SDKs with newly made tools built with better accuracy for agents.

### Generated types
In the previous Python SDK, one could generate the types for the tools using the CLI:
```bash
composio apps generate-types
```

This would provide the app slugs and tool slugs with IntelliSense support.

```python Python (old)
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, App, Action

print(App.GITHUB)
print(Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE)
```

This feature is a work in progress for both the Python and TypeScript SDKs.

<Tip>
  Give your AI IDE access to Composio's documentation using our llms.txt files: ([short
  .txt](/llms.txt), [long .txt](/llms-full.txt))
</Tip>

Composio is an integration and tooling platform built for AI agents and LLM applications that lets you:

- Add tool-use capabilities to your AI agent from [300+ apps](/tools/).
- Give agents [authenticated access to tools](/docs/custom-auth-configs).
- [Listen and trigger](/docs/using-triggers) agents and workflows from external events (e.g., new Slack message, GitHub issue).
- [Customize tools](/docs/modifiers/schema-modifiers) for proprietary APIs or specific functions.
- Seamlessly integrate tool-calling into frameworks like OpenAI Agents, Vercel AI, LangChain, etc.
- Refine tool interactions with [input/output processing](/docs/modifiers/before-execution) for greater reliability.

You get to connect your AI agents faster without wrestling with individual API integrations and managing their authentication or converting them into LLM tool calls.

We also optimise the tool calls for you for maximum accuracy, free of cost! ðŸ˜‰

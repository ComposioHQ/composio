## OpenAI Agents Provider

The OpenAI Agents Provider is a provider that formats the Composio tools into an object compatible with OpenAI's Agents API.

OpenAI Agents SDK is different from the OpenAI SDK. It's to help build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions.

## Setup

```bash
pip install composio[openai-agents] openai-agents
```

### Usage
```python Python maxLines=60 wordWrap
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner

from composio import Composio
from composio_openai_agents import OpenAIAgentsProvider

# Initialize Composio toolset
composio = Composio(provider=OpenAIAgentsProvider())

# Get all the tools
tools = composio.tools.get(
    user_id="default",
    tools=["GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER"],
)

# Create an agent with the tools
agent = Agent(
    name="GitHub Agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    tools=tools,
)

# Run the agent
async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(
        starting_agent=agent,
        input=(
            "Star the repository composiohq/composio on GitHub"
        ),
    )
    print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(main())
```

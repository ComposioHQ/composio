title: 'Injecting Custom Credentials'
subtitle: 'Execute actions using authentication tokens or keys provided at runtime'

While Composio excels at managing user connections via [Integrations](/auth/set-up-integrations) and the [connection flow](/auth/connection), there are scenarios where you might need to provide authentication credentials **directly** when executing an action. This bypasses Composio's stored Connections entirely.

This is achieved using the `auth` parameter within the `execute_action` method.

## The `auth` parameter in `execute_action`

When calling `execute_action`, you can include an `auth` object (Python `dict` / TS `object`) to specify the credentials Composio should use for that specific API call. This overrides any attempt Composio would normally make to look up credentials based on `entity_id` or `connected_account_id`.

The core of the `auth` object is the `parameters` list, which defines the credentials and how they should be injected into the API request.

**`CustomAuthParameter` Structure:**

Each item in the `parameters` list should be an object with:

*   `name`: (`str`) The name of the credential parameter (e.g., `"Authorization"`, `"X-Api-Key"`, `"api_key"`).
*   `value`: (`str`) The actual secret value (e.g., `"Bearer xyz..."`, `"sk-abc..."`).
*   `in_` (Python) / `in` (TS): (`str` or `ParamPlacement`) Where to place the parameter in the HTTP request. Common values include:
    *   `"header"` / `ParamPlacement.Header`: In the request headers.
    *   `"query"` / `ParamPlacement.Query`: As a URL query parameter.
    *   `"path"` / `ParamPlacement.Path`: As part of the URL path (less common for auth).
    *   `"subdomain"` / `ParamPlacement.Subdomain`: As part of the subdomain.

*(Optional fields like `base_url` and `body` can also exist within the top-level `auth` object for very specific authentication schemes, but `parameters` is the most common.)*

## Adding Custom Authentication to Tools

You can also execute *any* Composio tool (pre-built or custom-defined) using your own authentication credentials provided at runtime. This is useful if you manage tokens or API keys separately from Composio's connection system.

Use the `execute_action` method and provide the `auth` parameter.

**Example: Create GitHub Issue with an existing Bearer Token**

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Python example providing a custom Bearer token
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, Action, App
from composio.client.collections import CustomAuthParameter

toolset = ComposioToolSet()
bearer_token = "ghp_YourPersonalAccessToken..."  # Replace with your actual token

toolset.add_auth(
    app=App.GITHUB,
    parameters=[
        CustomAuthParameter(
            name="Authorization",
            in_="header",
            value=bearer_token,
        )
    ],
)


print("Creating issue using custom auth...")
try:
    result = toolset.execute_action(
        action=Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE,
        params={
            "owner": "your-username",
            "repo": "test-repo",
            "title": "Issue Created with Custom Token",
            "body": "This issue uses an externally provided auth token.",
        },
    )
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```
</CodeGroup>


### Using DescopeAuth (for Descope)
You can also use `DescopeAuth` for simpler Descope integration.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio.utils.descope import DescopeAuth

# Initialize DescopeAuth with your credentials
descope = DescopeAuth(
    project_id="your_project_id",    # Or uses DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID env var
    management_key="your_management_key"  # Or uses DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY env var
)

toolset = ComposioToolSet()

# Add authentication using DescopeAuth
toolset.add_auth(
    app=App.GITHUB,
    parameters=descope.get_auth(
        app=App.GITHUB,
        user_id="your_user_id",
        scopes=["user", "public_repo"]  # Permissions for the token
    )
)
```
</CodeGroup>

The `DescopeAuth` utility simplifies authentication with Descope by:
- Generating the necessary authentication tokens for external services
- Managing the authorization headers and metadata
- Setting appropriate scopes for the required permissions
- Managing tokens at both a user and tenant level
- Associating tokens with pre-existing app identities (using Descope as an auth provider)

**Additional Context for DescopeAuth Usage**

To use `DescopeAuth`, ensure you have the required `project_id` and `management_key` from your Descope account. These credentials are necessary to authenticate and generate the required headers for API calls. The `scopes` parameter defines the permissions for the generated token.

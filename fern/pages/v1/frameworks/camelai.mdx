**Composio enables** your **CAMEL agents** to **connect** with many **tools**!

<Tip>Goal: Star a repository on GitHub with natural language & CAMEL Agent</Tip>

### Install Packages & Connect a Tool

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed and connect your GitHub account to allow your CAMEL-AI agents to utilize GitHub functionalities.
<CodeGroup>
    ``` bash Run command
    pip install camel-ai
    pip install composio-camel -U
    #  Connect your GitHub so agents can use it. 
    composio add github
    #  Check all different apps which you can connect with
    composio apps
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Goal: Prepare your environment by initializing necessary imports from Composio & CAMEL.

<Steps>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

Prepare your environment by initializing necessary imports from Composio & CAMEL.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Default Imports
    from colorama import Fore
    from camel.agents import ChatAgent
    from camel.configs import ChatGPTConfig
    from camel.messages import BaseMessage
    from camel.models import ModelFactory
    from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
    from camel.utils import print_text_animated
    from composio_camel import ComposioToolSet, Action

    ```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Integrating GitHub Tools with Composio">

This step involves fetching and integrating GitHub tools provided by Composio, enabling enhanced functionality for CAMEL operations.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python CAMEL Supported tools from Composio
    composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()
    tools = composio_toolset.get_tools(
        actions=[Action.GITHUB_ACTIVITY_STAR_REPO_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER]
    )
    ```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="CAMEL Agent Setup">

This step involves configuring and executing the agent to carry out actions, such as starring a GitHub repository.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python CAMEL Agent Setup
    assistant_model_config = ChatGPTConfig(
        temperature=0.0,
        tools=tools,
    )

    model = ModelFactory.create(
        model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
        model_type=ModelType.GPT_3_5_TURBO,
        model_config_dict=assistant_model_config.__dict__,
    )


    # set up agent
    assistant_sys_msg = BaseMessage.make_assistant_message(
        role_name="Developer",
        content=(
            "You are a programmer as well an experienced github user. "
            "When asked given a instruction, "
            "you try to use available tools, and execute it"
        ),
    )

    agent = ChatAgent(
        assistant_sys_msg,
        model,
        tools=tools,
    )
    agent.reset()
    ```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Execute with your prompt/task.">

Execute the following code to execute the agent, ensuring that the intended task has been successfully completed.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python CAMEL Agent Execution
    prompt = (
        "I have created a new GitHub Repo,"
        "Please star my github repository: camel-ai/camel"
    )
    user_msg = BaseMessage.make_user_message(role_name="User", content=prompt)
    print(Fore.YELLOW + f"User prompt:\n{prompt}\n")

    response = agent.step(user_msg)
    for msg in response.msgs:
        print_text_animated(Fore.GREEN + f"Agent response:\n{msg.content}\n")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="TRELLO_UPDATE_LABELS_BY_ID_LABEL">
This endpoint allows you to update the attributes of an existing trello label. it can be used to modify the color, name, or board association of a label. the endpoint is particularly useful when you need to reorganize your trello boards, refine your labeling system, or simply make changes to existing labels. you can update any combination of the label's color, name, or board association in a single request. note that all parameters are optional, allowing for partial updates. if a parameter is not included in the request, that attribute of the label will remain unchanged. this endpoint should not be used to create new labels or to delete existing ones, as separate endpoints exist for those operations.

<Accordion title="TRELLO_DELETE_MEMBERS_SAVED_SEARCHES_BY_ID_MEMBER_BY_ID_SAVED_SEARCH">
This endpoint deletes a specific saved search for a trello member. saved searches allow users to quickly access frequently used search terms and filters within trello. this operation permanently removes the saved search from the member's account, freeing up space and decluttering their saved searches list. use this endpoint when a user wants to remove an outdated or no longer needed saved search. it's important to note that this action cannot be undone, so confirmation from the user before deletion is recommended. the endpoint requires both the member's id and the specific saved search id to ensure precise targeting of the item to be deleted.

<Accordion title="TRELLO_UPDATE_CARDS_CLOSED_BY_ID_CARD">
This endpoint updates the closed status of a specific trello card. it allows you to mark a card as closed (completed) or open (active) by setting its 'closed' attribute. use this endpoint when you need to change the completion status of a task represented by a trello card. the operation is particularly useful for automating workflow processes, such as closing cards when tasks are finished or reopening them if further action is required. note that closing a card doesn't delete it or move it to the archive; it simply marks it as completed within its current list. this endpoint should be used judiciously as it directly affects the visible state of cards on trello boards.

<Accordion title="TRELLO_UPDATE_SESSIONS_BY_ID_SESSION">
The updatetrellosession endpoint allows you to update the attributes of a specific trello session. it is used to keep track of a user's current activity within the trello application, including which board they are viewing and their overall session status. this endpoint is crucial for maintaining real-time updates and user presence information across the trello platform. you should use this endpoint when a user switches to a different board or when their session status changes (e.g., becoming idle or disconnecting). it helps trello optimize performance by focusing updates on active boards and users. however, be aware that updating the session too frequently may impact system performance, so it's best to call this endpoint only when there are meaningful changes in the user's activity or board focus. note that this endpoint does not provide any information about the board or user beyond what is updated. it is solely for updating session attributes and does not return detailed board or user data.

<Accordion title="TRELLO_UPDATE_MEMBERS_SAVED_SEARCHES_NAME_BY_ID_MEMBER_BY_ID_SAVED_SEARCH">
This endpoint allows you to update the name of a specific saved search for a trello member. it's used when a user wants to rename one of their existing saved searches, making it easier to organize and identify their frequently used search queries. the endpoint requires the member's id and the id of the saved search to be updated, both of which should be provided in the url path. this tool is particularly useful for maintaining an organized workspace in trello, especially for users who rely heavily on saved searches to quickly access specific sets of cards or boards. note that this feature is typically available only to paid trello subscribers, and updating a saved search name doesn't affect the search criteria itself, only its identifier.

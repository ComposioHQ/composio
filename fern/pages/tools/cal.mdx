## Actions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="CAL_CHECK_CALENDAR_VERSION_2">
The checkcalendaravailability endpoint retrieves the availability status of a specified calendar. it allows users to check free/busy times, ensuring efficient scheduling and resource management. this endpoint is particularly useful when you need to determine suitable time slots for scheduling events or meetings. it provides a snapshot of the calendar's current availability without exposing detailed event information. use this endpoint before attempting to schedule new events to avoid conflicts and optimize time management. note that the endpoint may have limitations on how far into the future it can check availability, and the granularity of the availability data may vary depending on the calendar's settings and the api's capabilities.

**Action Parameters**

<ParamField path="calendar" type="string" required={true}>
</ParamField>


**Action Response**

<Accordion title="CAL_HANDLE_CONFERENCING_OAUTH_CALLBACK_FOR_APP">
Handles the oauth callback for conferencing applications integrated with cal. this endpoint is called by the conferencing service provider after a user has granted authorization to integrate the conferencing app with cal. it completes the oauth flow by exchanging the authorization code for an access token, which cal then uses to interact with the conferencing api on behalf of the user. this endpoint should be used as the redirect uri when setting up the oauth integration with the conferencing service provider. it's important to note that this endpoint is part of the authentication process and should not be called directly by client applications. the response from this endpoint typically redirects the user back to the cal application with the authentication result.

**Action Parameters**

<Accordion title="CAL_RESCHEDULE_BOOKING_BY_UID">
Reschedules an existing booking in the cal system to a new date and time. this endpoint allows users to change the scheduled time of an appointment or event without canceling and recreating it. it should be used when a user needs to modify the timing of an existing booking due to changes in availability or preferences. the endpoint takes the unique identifier of the booking and likely expects new scheduling details in the request body (not specified in the given schema). it's important to note that this operation modifies an existing booking, so it should be used carefully to avoid conflicts with other scheduled events or availability constraints. the endpoint does not provide information about available time slots; it's assumed that the new schedule has been validated beforehand.

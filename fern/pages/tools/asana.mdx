<Accordion title="ASANA_DELETE_A_MEMBERSHIP">
Removes a user's membership from a specific portfolio or workspace in asana. this endpoint should be used when you need to revoke a user's access to a particular portfolio or workspace. it's important to note that this action is permanent and cannot be undone through the api. use this endpoint with caution, as it will immediately remove the user's ability to access and interact with the associated portfolio or workspace. this operation does not delete the user's account from asana entirely, but only removes their specific membership to the indicated resource.

This endpoint allows you to search for tasks within a specific asana workspace. it's designed to help users find and retrieve task information efficiently, supporting complex queries and filters. use this endpoint when you need to locate specific tasks or groups of tasks based on various criteria such as assignee, due date, or custom fields. the search functionality is powerful for large workspaces with numerous tasks, enabling precise filtering and sorting. however, be aware that the search may not include tasks in projects you don't have access to within the workspace. for real-time updates or simple task retrieval, consider using more specific task endpoints instead.

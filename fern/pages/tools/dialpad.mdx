## Actions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="DIALPAD_FETCH_CALL_TRANSCRIPT_BY_ID">
Retrieves the transcript for a specific call in the dialpad system. this endpoint allows you to fetch the text representation of the spoken content from a particular call or meeting. it's useful for reviewing conversation details, analyzing call content, or creating searchable records of communications. the transcript is generated using dialpad's ai-powered transcription feature, which provides accurate text conversion of audio content. use this endpoint when you need to access the written record of a call for purposes such as quality assurance, training, or content analysis. note that the availability and accuracy of transcripts may depend on the audio quality of the original call and the capabilities of the ai transcription system.

**Action Parameters**

<ParamField path="call_id" type="integer" required={true}>

<Accordion title="DIALPAD_PATCH_USER_STATUS">
Updates the status of a specific user in the dialpad system. this endpoint allows you to set or modify a user's status message and optionally specify an expiration time for that status. it's particularly useful for indicating a user's availability, current activity, or temporary absence. the endpoint should be used when you need to programmatically update a user's status, such as integrating with calendar systems, automatic out-of-office settings, or custom workflow automations. it's important to note that this endpoint updates the status for a single user identified by their id in the url path. the status update is immediate, and if an expiration is set, the status will automatically clear at the specified time. this tool does not retrieve the current status; it only updates it. if you need to fetch the current status before updating, you would need to use a separate get endpoint (not provided in this schema).

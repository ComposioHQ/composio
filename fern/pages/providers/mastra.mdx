Mastra is a TypeScript native framework for building agents with tools and MCPs. It expects tools to be in the following format:
- Inputs: What information the tool needs to run (defined with an `inputSchema`, often using Zod).
- Outputs: The structure of the data the tool returns (defined with an outputSchema).
- Execution Logic: The code that performs the tool's action.
- Description: Text that helps the agent understand what the tool does and when to use it.

More documentation [here](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/tools-mcp/overview#creating-tools)

The Mastra provider formats the Composio tools into this format along with the execution logic so that agents can call and execute the Composio tools.

## Setup

```typescript TypeScript maxLines=60 wordWrap
npm install @composio/mastra
```

You can specify the provider in the constructor.

```typescript TypeScript maxLines=60 wordWrap
import { Composio } from "@composio/core";
import { MastraProvider } from "@composio/mastra";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const composio = new Composio({
  provider: new MastraProvider(),
});
```

## Usage

The tools are passed to the agent as a parameter.

```typescript TypeScript maxLines=60 wordWrap
const userId = "john doe";

const tools = await composio.tools.get(
  userId,
  {
    toolkits: ["SUPABASE"],
  }
);

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Supabase Agent",
  instructions: "You think therefore you are.",
  model: openai("gpt-4.1"),
  tools: tools,
});

const { text } = await agent.generate([
  { role: "user", content: "Tell me about my Supabase project" },
]);

console.log("\nðŸ¤– Agent Response:\n");
console.log(text);
```

This tutorial shows you a minimal example of a web server that can use Composio.


### Install dependencies

Using `bun` for this example, it is super convenient for rapid prototyping.

```bash
bun install @composio/core@next openai hono
```

Please set the following environment variables:

```bash
# .env
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

The full source code is available [here](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/next/fern/pages/examples/src/sample-webserver/index.ts).

In this tutorial, we will create an auth config, initiate a connection, and send an email.

### Setup

Basic scaffolding for the server.

<SnippetCode
  src="./index.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={10}
  title="Setup"
  highlightStart={9}
  highlightEnd={9}
/>


### Auth Configs

These are configurations for tools that control how they are authorized, the scopes, and permissions they have. You can learn more about them [here](/authenticating-tools).

For this example, we will create a basic GMAIL auth config.

You are recommended to store these config IDs, so that you can reuse them later.

<SnippetCode
  src="./index.ts"
  startLine={12}
  endLine={16}
  title="Auth Configs"
/>


### Initiating a connection

Connections are your users authorizing your tools.

Here we start the connection process. Once your user uses the `redirectUrl` from the response, 
they will be redirected to the auth flow. 
Once they have authorized the connection, you can use the `id` to get and execute the tools as the user.

<SnippetCode
  src="./index.ts"
  startLine={16}
  endLine={27}
  title="Initiating a connection"
  highlightStart={19}
  highlightEnd={19}
/>

You can test your server by running `bun run index.ts` and then running the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/create-connection \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"userId": "123"}'
```

### Sending an email

Now let's send that email.

<SnippetCode
  src="./index.ts"
  startLine={29}
  endLine={59}
  title="Sending an email"
  highlightStart={56}
  highlightEnd={56}
/>

Using the `id` from the connection, we can now send an email.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send-email \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"userId": "123", "feedback": "These docs are great!"}'
```


### Full Code

You can see the full code [here](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/next/fern/pages/src/examples/sample-webserver/index.ts).


### What just happened?

Well, first - we created an instance of our `gmail` tool with our default auth config, then our user authorized that tool with their account and some permissions.

Then we used that `gmail` tool by giving it to OpenAI's `gpt-4o`. The model composed the email and sent it correctly formatted to the Composio team.

### What's next?

This is a fairly basic example, but you can do a lot more with our SDK.

Recommended further reading:

- [Authenticating tools](/authenticating-tools) - understand how to control tool authorization
- [Executing Tools](/executing-tools) - understand how tool execution works
- [Providers](/providers) - want to use something other than OpenAI? We probably support it
- [Tools](/tools) - understand what tools we have

This guide walks you through **authenticated tool calling**—the foundation of how Composio connects your AI agents to real-world actions.

You'll learn how to:
1. **Discover and add tools** relevant to your use case (e.g., Slack, GitHub, Notion) to your AI agent
2. **Authenticate tools** securely on behalf of a specific user, with fine-grained access control
3. **Enable your LLM** (like OpenAI, Claude, or LangChain) to invoke these tools reliably using structured tool call formats

Composio provides first-class SDKs for both **TypeScript** and **Python**, making it easy to integrate no matter what stack you're building with.

**Before you start!**
<Accordion title='Prerequisites'>
1. Ensure you have created an account on [Composio](https://app.composio.dev) and have Python 3.8+ _or_ NodeJS 18+ installed!
2. Get your API key from the [developer dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/developers) and set it as an environment variable.
```bash
export COMPOSIO_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
<Note title="Note!">Ensure you save the API key in a `.env` file and don't commit it to version control!</Note>
</Accordion>

## Install the SDK
First, install the Composio SDK for your preferred language:

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="Python" for="python"
pip install composio==0.8.0
```
```bash title="TypeScript" for="typescript"
npm install @composio/core
```
</CodeGroup>

## Initialize the SDK
You’ll need to initialize the SDK with your Composio API key. This allows you to authenticate requests and access tools on behalf of your users.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import Composio

composio = Composio(
  # api_key="your-api-key",
)
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { Composio } from '@composio/core';

// Initialize the SDK
const composio = new Composio({
  // apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});
```
</CodeGroup>


## Authorize Tools & Run Them with an Agent
Composio supports multiple LLM providers. Here’s how to use Composio with some of the most popular ones:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="OpenAI (Python)">
Composio ships with support for OpenAI provider out of the box.
<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/get-started/python/quickstart.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={34}
/>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Anthropic (Typescript)">
You may install the Anthropic provider as well!

**Installation**
```bash
npm install @composio/anthropic
```

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/get-started/typescript/quickstart.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={30}
/>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Vercel AI SDK (Typescript)">
You may install the Vercel AI provider as well!

**Installation**
```bash
npm install @composio/vercel
```

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/get-started/typescript/vercel-quickstart.ts"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={34}
/>

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenAI Agents (Python)">
You may install the OpenAI Agents provider as well!

**Installation**
```bash
pip install composio_openai_agents==0.8.0
```

<SnippetCode
  src="fern/snippets/get-started/python/quickstart-openai-agents.py"
  startLine={1}
  endLine={46}
/>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note title="What just happened?">
You just:
1. Authorized a user account with Composio 
2. Passed those tool permissions into an LLM framework 
3. Let the LLM securely call real tools on the user’s behalf

All OAuth flows and tool execution were automatically handled by Composio.

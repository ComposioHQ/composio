Connect your AI agents to real-world with managed authentication and tools from
Composio. The Composio SDKs and API enable you to build AI agents that can
take real-world actions without you needing to write and manage complex authentication
flows or tool formatting.

## Managed Tools and Authentication

Composio has over 10000 [tools](/docs/tools) across 500+ [toolkits](/docs/toolkits) which will
accelerate your AI agent development, and a managed set of [authentication](/docs/authentication)
flows to reduce the boilerplate for managing your users. To get started, you can
follow one of these guides below.

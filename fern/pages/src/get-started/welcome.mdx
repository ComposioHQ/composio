<Tip>
  Give your AI IDE access to Composio's documentation using our llms.txt files: ([short
  .txt](/llms.txt), [long .txt](/llms-full.txt))
</Tip>

Composio is the fastest way to allow your agents to take action across your apps.

- Support [3000+ out of the box tools](/tools/) across hundreds of apps.
- Precisely control the access and data your agents get and can use, with [fine grained access control](/docs/authenticating-tools)
- [Listen and trigger](/docs/using-triggers) agents and workflows from external events (e.g., new Slack message, GitHub issue).
- [Customize tools](/docs/modifiers/schema-modifiers) for proprietary APIs or specific functions.
- Seamlessly integrate tool-calling into frameworks like OpenAI Agents, Vercel AI, LangChain, etc. 
- Refine tool interactions with [input/output processing](/docs/modifiers/before-execution) for greater reliability.

You get to connect your AI agents faster without wrestling with individual API integrations and managing their authentication or converting them into LLM tool calls.

We also optimise the tool calls for you for maximum accuracy, free of cost! ðŸ˜‰

In-case you run into a situation where you cannot find a tool that you need as
part of the toolkit, you can use the execute proxy function on the SDK to execute
an HTTP request for any endpoint. This is also helpful if you want to customize
the experiece for a particular tool/endpoint.

## Using Execute Proxy

    ```python Python
    from composio import Composio

    composio = Composio(api_key="<COMPOSIO_API_KEY>")
    response = composio.tools.proxy(
        endpoint="/repos/composiohq/composio/issues/1",
        method="GET",
        connected_account_id="ac_1234",  # use connected account for github
    )
    print(response)
    ```

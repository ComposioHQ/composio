## OpenAI Agents Provider

The OpenAI Agents Provider is a provider that formats the Composio tools into an object compatible with OpenAI's Agents API.

OpenAI Agents SDK is different from the OpenAI SDK. It helps build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions.

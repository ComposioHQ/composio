Mastra is a TypeScript native framework for building agents with tools and MCPs. It expects tools to be in the following format:
- Inputs: What information the tool needs to run (defined with an `inputSchema`, often using Zod).
- Outputs: The structure of the data the tool returns (defined with an `outputSchema`).
- Execution Logic: The code that performs the tool's action.
- Description: Text that helps the agent understand what the tool does and when to use it.

More documentation [here](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/tools-mcp/overview#creating-tools)

The Mastra provider formats the Composio tools into this format along with the execution logic so that agents can call and execute the Composio tools.

## Usage
You can specify the provider in the constructor and then get and pass the relavent tools to the mastra agent.

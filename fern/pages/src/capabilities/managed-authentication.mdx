## ~~How it works~~

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import Composio

composio = Composio(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Create an authentication link for your user
auth_link = composio.connected_accounts.link(
    user_id="user-123",
    toolkit="github"
)

# User authenticates via the link
print(f"Send this link to user: {auth_link.url}")

# Execute authenticated actions
result = composio.tools.execute(
    "GITHUB_CREATE_REPO",
    user_id="user-123",
    arguments={"name": "my-new-repo"}
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Composio } from '@composio/core';

const composio = new Composio({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Create an authentication link for your user
const authLink = await composio.connectedAccounts.link({
  userId: 'user-123',
  toolkit: 'github'
});

// User authenticates via the link
console.log(`Send this link to user: ${authLink.url}`);

// Execute authenticated actions
const result = await composio.tools.execute('GITHUB_CREATE_REPO', {
  userId: 'user-123',
  arguments: { name: 'my-new-repo' }
});
```

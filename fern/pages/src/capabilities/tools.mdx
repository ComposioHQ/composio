<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import Composio

composio = Composio(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get tools for a user
tools = composio.tools.get(
    user_id="user-123",
    toolkits=["github", "slack"]
)

# Execute any tool with natural language arguments
result = composio.tools.execute(
    "GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE",
    user_id="user-123",
    arguments={
        "repo": "my-repo",
        "title": "Bug: Login not working",
        "body": "Users report login failures after update"
    }
)

print(f"Issue created: {result.data['html_url']}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Composio } from '@composio/core';

const composio = new Composio({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Get tools for a user
const tools = await composio.tools.get({
  userId: 'user-123',
  toolkits: ['github', 'slack']
});

// Execute any tool with natural language arguments
const result = await composio.tools.execute('GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE', {
  userId: 'user-123',
  arguments: {
    repo: 'my-repo',
    title: 'Bug: Login not working',
    body: 'Users report login failures after update'
  }
});

console.log(`Issue created: ${result.data.html_url}`);
```

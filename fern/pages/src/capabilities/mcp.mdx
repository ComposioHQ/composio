~~**Connect 800+ tools to any MCP-compatible AI client**  
Works with Claude Desktop, Continue.dev, and custom clients—no code changes needed. Just configure and connect.~~

## ~~Key capabilities~~

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Universal compatibility" icon="fa-solid fa-infinity">
    ~~Works with any MCP client—Claude Desktop, Continue.dev, or your custom implementation.~~
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="800+ tools instantly" icon="fa-solid fa-rocket">
    ~~All Composio tools available through a single MCP server configuration.~~
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Zero code required" icon="fa-solid fa-code-branch">
    ~~Configure once in JSON, use everywhere. No SDK integration needed.~~
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Automatic updates" icon="fa-solid fa-arrows-rotate">
    ~~New tools and capabilities added automatically without client updates.~~
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## ~~How it works~~

<CodeGroup>
```json claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "composio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@composio/mcp-server",
        "{YOUR_COMPOSIO_API_KEY}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```python Python SDK Alternative
# Or use the Python MCP server
from composio import Composio

composio = Composio(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Start MCP server
composio.mcp.start_server(
    port=3000,
    allowed_toolkits=["github", "slack", "gmail"]
)

# Server now available for any MCP client to connect
print("MCP server running at localhost:3000")
```

```typescript TypeScript SDK Alternative
// Or use the TypeScript MCP server
import { Composio } from '@composio/core';

const composio = new Composio({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Start MCP server
await composio.mcp.startServer({
  port: 3000,
  allowedToolkits: ['github', 'slack', 'gmail']
});

// Server now available for any MCP client to connect
console.log('MCP server running at localhost:3000');
```

## ~~MCP vs Native SDK~~

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to use MCP">
    ~~- Working with MCP-compatible clients (Claude Desktop, Continue.dev)~~
    ~~- Want framework-agnostic integration~~
    ~~- Need quick setup without code changes~~
    ~~- Building polyglot applications~~
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When to use Native SDK">
    ~~- Need programmatic control over tool execution~~
    ~~- Want to implement custom authentication flows~~
    ~~- Require response transformations or middleware~~
    ~~- Building production applications with specific requirements~~
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use both?">
    ~~Yes! MCP and Native SDK can work together. Use MCP for desktop tools and Native SDK for your application backend.~~

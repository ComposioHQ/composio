## ~~How it works~~

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import Composio

composio = Composio(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Set up a trigger for GitHub push events
trigger = composio.triggers.subscribe(
    user_id="user-123",
    trigger_name="GITHUB_PUSH_EVENT",
    config={
        "repository": "my-repo",
        "branch": "main"
    }
)

# Handle incoming events
@trigger.on_event
def handle_push(event):
    print(f"New commit: {event['commit_message']}")
    
    # Automatically create a deployment
    composio.tools.execute(
        "VERCEL_CREATE_DEPLOYMENT",
        user_id="user-123",
        arguments={
            "repo": event["repository"],
            "branch": event["branch"]
        }
    )
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Composio } from '@composio/core';

const composio = new Composio({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Set up a trigger for GitHub push events
const trigger = await composio.triggers.subscribe({
  userId: 'user-123',
  triggerName: 'GITHUB_PUSH_EVENT',
  config: {
    repository: 'my-repo',
    branch: 'main'
  }
});

// Handle incoming events
trigger.onEvent((event) => {
  console.log(`New commit: ${event.commit_message}`);
  
  // Automatically create a deployment
  composio.tools.execute('VERCEL_CREATE_DEPLOYMENT', {
    userId: 'user-123',
    arguments: {
      repo: event.repository,
      branch: event.branch
    }
  });
});

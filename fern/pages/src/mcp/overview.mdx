[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how LLM-powered applications provide _tools_ and relevant context to the underlying models.

The protocol follows a client server model, where the MCP server provides the tools and context to the MCP client.

All [tools](/tools) in Composio are also available through MCP servers.

## Getting Started
Composio MCP servers can be used in two ways:

**1. For end users:**
 Connect your accounts using our hosted MCP servers at [mcp.composio.dev](https://mcp.composio.dev)

**2. For developers:**
 You can enable MCP servers for your users via the [Composio Admin Dashboard](https://app.composio.dev) or by integrating directly with our [MCP API reference](/api-reference/mcp).


For detailed instructions on creating and configuring custom MCP servers, see the [developer guide](/docs/mcp-developers).

Composio MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers provide a powerful way to expose and integrate tools from various applications, making them accessible to any compatible MCP client or SDK. This creates a seamless bridge between your tools and AI agents, enabling rich, interactive functionality across your ecosystem.

With Composio MCP, get access to 
- **300+ toolkits** (Gmail, Linear, Slack, Notion and many more)
- **10,000+ tools**
- Completely managed OAuth and security.

To build with agents, one can customize the MCP server too.

## Getting Started
Composio MCP servers can be used in two ways:

**1. For end users:**
 Connect your accounts using our hosted MCP servers at [mcp.composio.dev](https://mcp.composio.dev)

**2. For developers:**
 You can enable MCP servers for your users via the [Composio Admin Dashboard](https://app.composio.dev) or by integrating directly with our [MCP API reference](/api-reference/mcp).


For detailed instructions on creating and configuring custom MCP servers, see the [developer guide](/docs/mcp-developers).

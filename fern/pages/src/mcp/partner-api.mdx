Composio has launched the **MCP Partner Program** â€” a simple way to get access to pre-configured MCP servers for over 200+ toolkits. Perfect for platforms and developers looking to distribute MCP servers to their own users with zero setup.

<Tip>
Want to embed ready-to-use MCP servers in your own clients or workflows? Join the partner program and get access instantly.

### What do partners get?

As a partner, you receive:

- **Access to curated MCP servers** for all supported toolkits  
- **One simple API** to fetch all the MCP servers linked to your partner org  
- **No infrastructure management or custom config required**

It's the fastest way to plug MCP into your platform.

### Getting started is easy

Just send an email to **[mcp@composio.dev](mailto:mcp@composio.dev)** and we'll onboard you.

Once onboarded, you'll get a unique API URL to fetch your MCP servers.

#### Example

If your company is called `lemon`, you can fetch your available MCP servers with:

```bash
GET https://mcp.composio.dev/api/partner/lemon/apps/list

```

#### Complete example

Here's a full curl request to fetch your MCP servers:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mcp.composio.dev/api/partner/lemon/apps/list \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Sample response:**

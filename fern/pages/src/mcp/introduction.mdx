Composio MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers provide a powerful way to expose and integrate tools from various applications, making them accessible to any compatible MCP client or SDK. This creates a seamless bridge between your tools and AI agents, enabling rich, interactive functionality across your ecosystem.

To learn about the MCP clients, see the MCP documentation.
To build with agents, one can customize the MCP server too.

## Creating Custom MCP Servers
<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Authentication">
    - **Configure app permissions:**
      Select the specific scopes and permissions your integration requires for each connected application. This ensures your MCP server has the right level of access.

    - **Customize the authentication experience (Optional):**
      Create a seamless, branded experience by providing your own OAuth credentials and customizing the consent screens.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and configure an MCP server">
    Making the following request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3/mcp/servers \
      -H "x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "Gmail MCP Server",
        "allowed_tools": [
          "GMAIL_FETCH_EMAIL",
          "GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT",
        ],
        "auth_config_ids": ["ac_auth_12"]
      }'
    ```
    The response looks like:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "5bc757cc-7a8e-431c-8616-7f57cbed2423",
      "name": "Gmail MCP Server"",
      "auth_config_ids": ["ac_auth_12"],
      "allowed_tools": [
        "GMAIL_FETCH_EMAIL",
        "GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT",
      ],
      "mcp_url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/composio/server/5bc757cc-7a8z-431c-8616-7f57cbed2421?transport=sse",
      "commands": {
        "cursor": "npx @composio/mcp@latest setup \"<mcp_url>\" --client cursor",
        "claude":  "npx @composio/mcp@latest setup \"<mcp_url>\" --client claude",
        "windsurf": "npx @composio/mcp@latest setup \"<mcp_url>\" --client windsurf"
      },
      "created_at": "2025-05-18T22:15:25.926Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-05-18T22:15:25.926Z",
      "managed_auth_via_composio": false
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Client applications connect to the server">
    The resultant `mcp_url`; (`https://mcp.composio.dev/composio/server/<UUID>?transport=sse`) is used by the client applications to connect to the server.  
    The URL accepts three optional query parameters:

| Query param | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `user_id` | Bind the session to a user identifier from your app. |
| `connected_account_id` | Pin the session to a specific Composio `connectedAccount` (skip account selection). |
| `include_composio_helper_actions=true` | Inject helper tools so the agent can walk the user through authentication when needed. |

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Currently, the default transport is `sse`. Support for `transport=http-stream` will be available soon.

### Configuring authentication
You or your users need to authenticate against an app to use it's MCP server through Composio!
This can be done in two ways:

* Authenticate users upfront via the Composio SDK/API. Follow [custom auth configs](/docs/custom-auth-configs) to learn how to connect users. This is recommended for most use cases
* Let the agent authenticate users on demand. Passing `include_composio_helper_actions=true` in the URL will include Composio's helper actions and the agent will guide the user through auth on demand.

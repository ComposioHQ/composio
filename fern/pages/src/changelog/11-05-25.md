# Enhanced MCP URL Security Requirements

We're introducing improved security requirements for Model Context Protocol (MCP) URLs to ensure better isolation between user connections and prevent unauthorized access.

## What's Changing?

Starting today, **all new Composio projects** must include at least one of the following parameters in their MCP URLs:
- `user_id` - Identifies the specific user
- `connected_account_id` - Identifies the specific connected account

## Why This Matters

This change ensures that:
- **User Isolation**: Each user's connections remain completely separate from others
- **Enhanced Security**: Prevents potential cross-user data access scenarios
- **Better Multi-Tenancy**: Enables safer multi-tenant application architectures
- **Explicit Access Control**: Forces developers to explicitly specify which user or account context they're operating in

## Impact on Existing Projects

**For existing projects**: We understand the importance of backward compatibility. While we've sent email notifications to project owners about upgrading their MCP URLs, **this is not a breaking change**. Your existing integrations will continue to work without interruption.

We strongly recommend updating your MCP URLs to include these parameters for enhanced security.

## Implementation Example

**Before:**
```
mcp://your-server.com/endpoint
```

**After (with user_id):**
```
mcp://your-server.com/endpoint?user_id=user_123
```

**After (with connected_account_id):**
```
mcp://your-server.com/endpoint?connected_account_id=acc_456
```

## Migration Guide

If you're using an existing project and want to adopt this security enhancement:

1. Review your current MCP URL configuration
2. Add either `user_id` or `connected_account_id` parameter to your URLs
3. Update your application code to pass the appropriate identifier
4. Test the updated URLs in your development environment

For more details on choosing the right user identifiers for your application, see our [User Management documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/docs/user-management).

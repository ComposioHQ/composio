# Transition to Self-Managed Credentials for Select Applications

<Note>
This is a **non-breaking change**. Your existing integrations will continue to work as expected. This change only affects new integrations with the applications listed below.
</Note>

## What's Changing?

Starting today, the following applications will require **your own developer credentials** instead of Composio-managed credentials:

- **Auth0**
- **Blackbaud**
- **BoldSign**
- **Deel**
- **Front**
- **GoToWebinar**
- **PagerDuty**
- **Pipedrive**
- **Shopify**
- **Strava**
- **SurveyMonkey**
- **Webex**

## What You Need to Do

To continue using these applications with Composio:

1. **Create Developer Accounts**: Register for developer accounts on the platforms you need
2. **Generate API Credentials**: Create OAuth apps following each platform's documentation
3. **Configure in Composio**: Add your credentials to Composio using [custom auth configs](https://docs.composio.dev/docs/custom-auth-configs)
4. **Test Your Integration**: Test your integration with the new credentials

<Note>
All other Composio applications continue to work with Composio-managed credentials. This change only affects the 12 applications listed above.

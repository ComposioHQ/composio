# Connected Account Expiration for Incomplete Connections

We're implementing automatic expiration for connected accounts that remain in incomplete states, helping maintain a cleaner and more efficient authentication system.

## What's Changing?

Connected accounts in `Initializing` and `Initiated` states will now automatically expire after **10 minutes**. This applies to connection attempts that were started but never completed.

## Why This Matters

This change provides:
- **Better Resource Management**: Automatically cleans up incomplete connection attempts
- **Improved System Hygiene**: Prevents accumulation of stale, unused connection records
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Reduces clutter from abandoned authentication flows

## Impact

**For users**: If you start a connection flow but don't complete it within 10 minutes, you'll need to initiate a new connection. This ensures that only active, completed connections remain in your account.

**For developers**: No code changes are required. This is a backend improvement that happens automatically.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about this change, please reach out to our support team or check our [Connected Accounts documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/docs/connected-accounts).

# Connected Account Expiration for Incomplete Connections

We're implementing automatic expiration for connected accounts that remain in incomplete states, helping maintain a cleaner and more efficient authentication system.

## What's Changing?

Connected accounts in `Initializing` and `Initiated` states will now automatically expire after **10 minutes**. This only applies to OAuth connection attempts that were started but never completed; other connection types are not affected.

## Why This Matters

This change provides:
- **Better Resource Management**: Automatically cleans up incomplete connection attempts
- **Improved System Hygiene**: Prevents accumulation of stale, unused connection records
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Reduces clutter from abandoned authentication flows

<Note>
This is a **non-breaking change**. Your existing integrations and completed connections will continue to work as expected. This change only affects connection attempts that are never completed.
</Note>

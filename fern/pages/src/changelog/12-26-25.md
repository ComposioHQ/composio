# Authentication Updates Across Multiple Toolkits

We've updated authentication configurations for several toolkits to improve security, fix issues, and support additional deployment options.

## Summary

| Toolkit | Change Type | Action Required |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Ashby | Deprecated | No |
| Freshdesk | Deprecated | No |
| Freshservice | Deprecated | No |
| Make | Breaking | New auth config + user reconnect |
| Mixpanel | Fix | No |
| Recall AI | Breaking | New auth config + user reconnect |
| Relevance AI | Breaking | New auth config + user reconnect |
| SmartRecruiters | Breaking | New auth config + user reconnect |
| Supabase | Improvement | No |
| Trello | Deprecated | No |
| ZoomInfo | Deprecated | No |

## Breaking Changes

These toolkits had incorrect or outdated authentication configurations that needed fixing. We verified that active usage for these toolkits is practically zero before proceeding with these changes.

**Impact**: Existing connections will stop working. You'll need to create new auth configs and ask affected users to reconnect.

### Make

Replaced region-based configuration with full base URL input. Users now provide the complete Make instance URL (e.g., `https://us2.make.com` or `https://us1.make.celonis.com`) instead of just a region code.

### Recall AI

Updated from region-based to full base URL configuration. Fixed field descriptions and metadata. Updated categories to AI/Productivity/Communication and added proper documentation links.

### Relevance AI

Simplified authentication by removing deprecated Project ID field. Added conditional mapping for region codes to API subdomains (AU→f1db6c, EU→d7b62b, US→bcbe5a). Region field now defaults to US.

### SmartRecruiters

Fixed OAuth configuration with correct SmartRecruiters endpoints. Added proper default scopes for candidates, jobs, and users. Enabled PKCE and added refresh token support.

## Deprecated (Still Working)

These changes introduce new auth methods while keeping old ones functional:

### Ashby

Added new API Key authentication scheme with automatic base64 encoding and proper authorization headers.

**No Action Required**: Old Basic Auth method is deprecated but continues to work. Existing connections are unaffected.

### Freshdesk

Added new API Key authentication scheme requiring subdomain and API key with automatic base64 encoding.

**No Action Required**: Old Basic Auth method is deprecated but continues to work. Existing connections are unaffected.

### Freshservice

Added new API Key authentication scheme requiring subdomain and API key with automatic base64 encoding.

**No Action Required**: Old Basic Auth method is deprecated but continues to work. Existing connections are unaffected.

### Trello

Marked Bearer Token authentication as deprecated in favor of OAuth authentication.

**No Action Required**: Old Bearer auth continues to function. OAuth is recommended for new connections.

### ZoomInfo

Added new OAuth2 authentication scheme with comprehensive scopes for contacts, companies, audiences, scoops, news, and intent data. Deprecated the old JWT-based Basic authentication. Password field now properly marked as secret.

**No Action Required**: Old JWT auth continues to function. New connections will use OAuth2.

## Non-Breaking Improvements

### Mixpanel

Fixed region mapping logic for data residency. Added proper conditional evaluation to map regions to correct API hosts (EU, India, or Standard). Region field is now optional and defaults to Standard server. Service account secret now properly marked as secret.

**No Action Required**: Existing connections continue to work without changes.

### Supabase

Changed `base_url` field type from `auth_config_field` to `connection_field` for both OAuth and API Key schemes. Updated base action logic to respect user-provided base URLs, enabling support for self-hosted Supabase instances.

**No Action Required**: Existing connections continue to work. Self-hosted instances now supported.

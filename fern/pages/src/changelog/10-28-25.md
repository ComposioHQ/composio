## Tools Listing Now Requires Filters for Better Performance

### Summary
Due to the increased scale in the number of tools and their versions powered by Composio, listing tools now requires passing specific filters to ensure optimal performance and relevant results.

### Key Changes

#### Required Filters
Going forward, listing tools requires one of the following filters:
- ✅ **Tool slugs filter**: Specify specific tool slugs to retrieve
- ✅ **Toolkit slug filter**: Filter by specific toolkit(s)
- ✅ **Generic search**: Use search terms to find relevant tools

### Behavior

**After:** At least one filter parameter is required when listing tools:

### Breaking Changes
⚠️ **Breaking Change**: Listing tools without any filter parameters will now return an error. Users must specify at least one of:
1. `toolkit_slug` parameter
2. `tool_slugs` parameter  
3. `search` parameter

This change ensures better performance and more relevant results as the Composio ecosystem continues to scale.

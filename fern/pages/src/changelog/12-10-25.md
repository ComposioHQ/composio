# Typed Responses Across Toolkits

We've updated many toolkits so their outputs are now strongly typed objects instead of a generic `response_data` blob, meaning tools like Outlook, HubSpot, Notion, etc. now return well-shaped, documented fields you can rely on directly in your code and agents. These improvements apply to the latest toolkit versions—see our [toolkit versioning docs](https://docs.composio.dev/docs/toolkit-versioning) for how versions are managed.

**Breaking Change for `latest` Version**

If you're using the `latest` version and your code post-processes the old `response_data` structure, you'll need to update your code to work with the new flattened, typed response schemas.
</Callout>

## Why This Matters
- Better developer experience for direct execute: clear fields and types
- Improved agent performance: flatter output shapes with explicit fields reduce nesting and invalid params
- Clearer docs and type safety: richer metadata for IDEs and autocomplete

## Before vs After
**Previous (generic, version `20251202_00`):**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "response_data": { "...": "..." }
  },
  "successful": true
}
```

**Now (typed example – Outlook List Messages, version `20251209_00`):**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users('me')/messages",
    "@odata.nextLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$skip=10",
    "value": [
      {
        "id": "abc123",
        "subject": "Hi there",
        "from": { "emailAddress": { "address": "a@b.com", "name": "Alice" } },
        "hasAttachments": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "successful": true
}
```

For the exact field mapping per toolkit, open `platform.composio.dev` → Toolkits → List Messages (or the relevant tool).

## Migration Notes
- Breaking change for consumers on the `latest` version who post-process the old nested `response_data` shape: outputs are now flattened and explicitly typed.
- New and modified fields include richer descriptions and examples; some legacy placeholders were removed.
- Re-fetch schemas for your tool/version to see the typed definitions. Use the toolkit view in `platform.composio.dev` for authoritative field details.

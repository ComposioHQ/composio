## Mandatory Link Auth for Composio-Managed OAuth

We're rolling out Link Auth for all OAuth connections that use **Composio-managed credentials** to improve platform security.

### Rollout Timeline

- **January 06, 2026** - Option to enable Link Auth is now available in Project Config
- **February 21, 2026** - Enabled by default for new organizations
- **April 06, 2026** - Enabled for all organizations

### What's Changing

- No action required on your side
- A small UX change during OAuth to improve platform security
- No changes if you use your own `client_id` and `client_secret`

### Why This Change

To align with modern OAuth security best practices, we're standardizing on Link Auth for all Composio-managed OAuth connections.

Link Auth ensures:

- **Secure, token-bound OAuth initiation**
- **Full protection against OAuth account takeover**: This guarantees OAuth connections are created only by the intended user, for the intended project, and within the correct security context.

### Enable & Test Early (Optional)

You can opt in before the rollout to preview and test the new behavior.

**How to enable:**
1. Go to your **Project Config** page
2. Enable the flag: `enableLinkFlowForManagedAuth`

Once enabled, all new OAuth connections using Composio-managed credentials will follow the Link Auth flow.

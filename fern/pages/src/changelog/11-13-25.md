# Required API Key Authentication for MCP URLs

We're strengthening the security of Model Context Protocol (MCP) URLs by making API key authentication mandatory for all requests.

## What's Changing?

Starting **December 15th, 2025**, **all new Composio projects** must include the `x-api-key` header when making requests to MCP URLs. This header authenticates your application and ensures secure communication with the Composio platform.

## Why This Matters

This change provides:
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Ensures only authorized applications can access MCP endpoints
- **Industry Best Practices**: Aligns with standard API security patterns

## Impact on Existing Projects

**For existing projects**: We value backward compatibility and understand the need for a smooth transition. Your existing MCP URLs will continue to work without the `x-api-key` header until **April 15th, 2026**.

**Important**: After April 15th, 2026, all MCP URL requests without the `x-api-key` header will be rejected. Please ensure you update your applications before this date to avoid service disruption.

**Note**: If you're already passing the `x-api-key` header in your MCP requests, no action is required—you're all set!

## Migration Guide

To adopt this security enhancement in your existing projects:

1. **Locate Your API Key**: Find your API key in the Composio dashboard under Project Settings
2. **Update Your Code**: Add the `x-api-key` header to all MCP URL requests
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify the updated requests work in your development environment
4. **Deploy**: Roll out the changes to your production environment

Tool Router is a unified interface that lets an agent **search**, **plan**, **authenticate**, and **execute** actions across thousands of Composio tools.

Consider an agent that works across Gmail, Notion, Slack, Google Drive, and hundreds of other apps. The challenges:

- Identifying the right tool for the task
- Managing context for complex queries with large responses
- Handling authentication across all of them

Tool Router exposes a set of meta-tools that handle all this complexity—including search to discover the right tools, and a workbench to process results without flooding context. 

This is what powers complex agentic products like [Rube](https://rube.app).

## Getting started

To use Tool Router, create a session for a user: 
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
session = composio.create(
    user_id='user_id_123',
    toolkits=['github', 'slack', 'gmail']
)

# session.mcp.url → Use with any MCP client
# session.tools() → Use with any agent  
# session.authorize() → Authenticate users to apps
# session.toolkits() → Get available toolkits and their connections
```

```typescript TypeScript
const { tools, mcp, authorize, toolkits } = await composio.create('user_id_123', {
  toolkits: ['github', 'slack', 'gmail'],
});

// mcp.url → Use with any MCP client
// tools() → Use with any agent  
// authorize() → Authenticate users to apps
// toolkits() → Get available toolkits and their connections
```
</CodeGroup>

Tool Router provides session-based tool routing for executing tools across different toolkits. 

<Note>
Tool Router is currently in experimental phase and only available in typescript. APIs and functionality may change as we continue to improve the feature based on user feedback.

## What is Tool Router?

Tool Router creates isolated, scoped sessions for executing tools across different services. Each session:
- Has its own unique MCP server endpoint 
- Has isolated Auth configurations that is scoped to a session
- Controls which tools are accessible
- Routes tool calls across services


## When to use Tool Router

Tool Router is ideal for orchestrating tools across multiple services (GitHub, Gmail, Slack, etc.) within a single scoped session.

## Core concepts

### Sessions
A session has:
- Unique session ID
- MCP-compatible server URL
- Specific toolkit configurations
- User authentication 

### Toolkit configuration
Each session can configure multiple toolkits with:
- Simple toolkit names (using default auth)
- Custom auth config IDs per toolkit
- Manual or automatic connection management

### MCP compatibility
Every Tool Router session provides:
- Standard MCP server endpoint
- Compatible with all MCP clients
- SSE transport support
- Tool discovery and execution

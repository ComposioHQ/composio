Tool Router is a unified interface that lets an agent **search**, **plan**, **authenticate**, and **execute** actions across thousands of Composio tools.

Consider an agent that works across Gmail, Notion, Slack, Google Drive, and hundreds of other apps. The challenges:

- **Search**: Identifying the right tool for the task
- **Context Management**: Managing context for complex queries with large responses
- **Authentication**: Handling authentication across all of them

Tool Router exposes a set of meta-tools that handle all this complexity including search to discover the right tools, and a workbench to process results without flooding context. 

This is what powers complex agentic products like [Rube](https://rube.app).

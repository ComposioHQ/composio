Tool Router automatically generates [Connect Link](/docs/authenticating-tools#hosted-authentication-connect-link) URLs when tools require authentication. Users complete OAuth or enter credentials on this hosted page.

## In-chat authentication

By default, Tool Router includes the `COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` meta-tool. When the agent tries to execute a tool and the user hasn't connected that account, the agent prompts them with a Connect Link URL.

The user clicks the link, authenticates in the hosted UI, and confirms in chat. The agent then retries the action.

This flow works well for chat applications where users interact directly with the agent. For details on configuring this flow, see [Using in-chat authentication](/tool-router/using-in-chat-authentication).

## Manual authentication

For applications that manage authentication outside of chat, disable in-chat auth and use `session.authorize()` to generate Connect Link URLs.

This flow works well for:
- Pre-authenticating users before they start chatting
- Building custom connection UIs

For implementation details, see [Manually authenticating users](/tool-router/manually-authenticating-users).

## How Tool Router manages auth configs

When executing a tool, Tool Router needs an auth config to find or create a connected account. It handles this automatically:

1. If you provide an `authConfigs` override, it uses that
2. Otherwise, it looks for an auth config it previously created for this toolkit
3. If none exists, it creates one using Composio managed auth and tags it for reuse
4. Future sessions automatically reuse that auth config

This means you don't need to create auth configs manually for most toolkits. Tool Router creates and manages them for you.

## Supported auth methods

Tool Router can automatically create auth configs for:

- **Composio managed OAuth** - GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and most OAuth toolkits. Composio provides the OAuth credentials.
- **API key auth** - Users provide their own API keys via Connect Link.

<Note>
Toolkits without Composio managed auth require you to create an auth config first. See [Configuring custom auth configs](/docs/tool-router/configuring-custom-auth-configs).
</Note>

## White-labeling

To show your own branding on OAuth consent screens instead of Composio's, create your own OAuth app and pass the auth config ID in your session. See [White-labeling authentication](/tool-router/white-labeling-authentication).

<Tip>
For step-by-step guides on creating OAuth apps for specific services, see [composio.dev/auth](https://composio.dev/auth).

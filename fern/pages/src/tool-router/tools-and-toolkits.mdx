Tool Router gives your agent access to most Composio toolkits by default. For details on configuring which toolkits are available in a session, see [Users and sessions](/tool-router/users-and-sessions#enabling-toolkits).

## Toolkits and tools

A **toolkit** is a collection of related tools for a service and a **tool** is an individual action your agent can execute.
For example, the `github` toolkit contains tools like `GITHUB_CREATE_A_COMMIT`, `GITHUB_ACTIVITY_LIST_STARGAZERS_FOR_REPO`, and `GITHUB_SEARCH_REPO_S`.

## Available toolkits

Browse all available toolkits in the [Composio platform](https://platform.composio.dev) under "All Toolkits". Each toolkit page shows its tools (with input and output parameters) and authentication methods supported for that toolkit.

<Note>
Some toolkits require you to provide your own credentials. See [Configuring custom auth configs](/tool-router/configuring-custom-auth-configs).
</Note>

<Tip>
Need a toolkit that doesn't exist? [Request it here](https://request.composio.dev/boards/tool-requests).
</Tip>

For details on browsing tools within toolkits and inspecting schemas, see [Fetching tools and schemas](/docs/fetching-tools).

## Default behavior

When you create a session, all toolkits are available:

<CodeGroup>
```python
session = composio.create(user_id="user_123")
```
```typescript
const session = await composio.create("user_123");
```
</CodeGroup>

Your agent can search and use tools from any toolkit. To restrict or configure which toolkits are available, see [Users and sessions](/tool-router/users-and-sessions#enabling-toolkits).

<Tip>
Triggers can be used alongside Tool Router to respond to events in connected apps. See [Using triggers](/docs/tools-and-triggers/using-triggers) for setup instructions.

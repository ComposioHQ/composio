## What just happened?

When you ran this agent, Tool Router handled everything behind the scenes:

1. **[Search](/tool-router/tool-search)** - Found the right Gmail tools from 1000+ available tools
2. **[Authentication](/tool-router/authentication)** - Prompted you to connect your Gmail account
3. **[Execution](/tool-router/tool-execution)** - Fetched your emails and processed results efficiently

All you wrote was a prompt. Tool Router handled the rest!

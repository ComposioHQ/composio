Build an interactive agent with access to 1000+ tools.

<Tab title="Claude Agent SDK">

<Steps>
<Step title="Install">
<CodeGroup>
```bash title="Python" for="python"
pip install composio claude-agent-sdk
```
```bash title="TypeScript" for="typescript"
npm install @composio/core @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Create session and run agent">
[Sessions](/tool-router/users-and-sessions) are ephemeral, user-scoped and manage connections and tools for that user.

<Info>
- Set your `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key from [Settings](https://platform.composio.dev/?next_page=/settings).
- Set your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable with your [Anthropic API key](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys).
- `userId` is your user's unique identifier. See [User Management](/docs/user-management) for details.
</Info>

When the agent needs authentication, it will prompt the user with a link to connect their account. If you want to customise the authentication flow and have more control over the user experience, see [Manual Authentication](/tool-router/manually-authenticating-users).

## What just happened?

When you ran this agent, Tool Router handled everything behind the scenes:

1. **[Search](/tool-router/tool-search)** - Found the right Gmail tools from 1000+ available tools
2. **[Authentication](/tool-router/authentication)** - Prompted you to connect your Gmail account
3. **[Execution](/tool-router/tool-execution)** - Fetched your emails and processed results efficiently

All you wrote was a prompt. Tool Router handled the rest!

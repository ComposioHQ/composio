## Calling Tools
Tool calling is a feature of all frontier LLMs to allow them to interact with the outside world. Earlier you might be able to ask an LLM to write you a nice email, but you would have to manually send it. With tool calling, you can now provide an LLM a valid tools for example, `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` to go and accomplish the task autonomously.

### For Agents
Composio's tools are built for agents first. This means that you can use them with any agent framework.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript maxLines=60 wordWrap
const messages: OpenAI.ChatCompletionMessageParam[] = [
  {
    role: "system",
    content: "You are a helpful assistant that can help with tasks.",
  },
  { role: "user", content: "Fetch the details of the user 'pg'" },
];

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages,
  tools: tools,
  tool_choice: "auto",
});

if (response.choices[0].message.tool_calls) {
  console.log(
    `✅ Calling tool ${response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function.name}`
  );
  const result = await composio.provider.handleToolCall(userId, response);
  const data = JSON.parse(result[0]);
  console.log(data);
}
```

```python Python maxLines=60 wordWrap
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that can help with tasks."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Fetch the details of the user 'pg'"}
]

response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=messages,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
)

if response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
    tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]
    print(f"✅ Calling tool {tool_call.function.name}")
    result = composio.provider.handle_tool_call(user_id, response)
    data = json.loads(result[0])
    print(data)
```
</CodeGroup>

### For Humans (manually)

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript maxLines=60 wordWrap
const userId = "your@email.com";
const composio = new Composio();

const result = await composio.tools.execute("HACKERNEWS_GET_USER", {
  userId,
  arguments: {
    username: "pg",
  },
});
console.log(result);
```

```python Python maxLines=60 wordWrap

user_id = "your@email.com"
composio = Composio()

result = composio.tools.execute(
    "HACKERNEWS_GET_USER",
    user_id=user_id,
    arguments={"username": "pg"}
)
print(result)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Tools are tied to a user
Each tool and tool action is scoped to a user. Hence, a `user_id` is required to fetch and execute tools.

The authentication state is checked and used while fetching and executing a tool.

For more information on authentication, see [Authentication](/docs/v3/authentication).

## Fetching and Inspecting Tools
To effectively use tools, it is recommended to fetch, inspect, and filter them based on your criteria. 

This process returns a union of all tools that match the specified criteria, ensuring you provide the most relevant tools to the agents.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript maxLines=60 wordWrap
const tools = await composio.tools.get(
  userId,
  {
    toolkits: ["GITHUB"],
    tools: ["HACKERNEWS_GET_USER"],
    important: "false", // filter by tools marked as important
    limit: "5", // limit the number of tools returned
  }
);

// Alternative way to search for tools
const tools_new = await composio.tools.get(
  userId,
  {
    search: "hackernews", // keyword search for tools
    limit: "5", // limit the number of tools returned
  }
```

```python Python maxLines=60 wordWrap

tools = composio.tools.get(
    user_id,
    toolkits=["GITHUB"],
    tools=["HACKERNEWS_GET_USER"],
    important=False,  # filter by tools marked as important
    limit=5  # limit the number of tools returned
)

# Alternative way to search for tools
tools_new = composio.tools.get(
    user_id,
    search="hackernews",  # keyword search for tools
    limit=5  # limit the number of tools returned
)
```

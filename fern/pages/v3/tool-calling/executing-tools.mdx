## Calling Tools
Tool calling is a feature of all frontier LLMs to allow them to interact with the outside world. Earlier you might be able to ask an LLM to write you a nice email, but you would have to manually send it. With tool calling, you can now provide an LLM a valid tools for example, `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` to go and accomplish the task autonomously.

### Using Chat Completions
For non-agent providers—such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI—you can process tool calls using the tool call handlers provided by the Composio SDK.
This approach works consistently across all supported non-agent providers.

To learn how to setup these providers, see [Providers](/providers).

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript (Anthropic) maxLines=60
const userId = "user@acme.com"; // User's UUID

const composio = new Composio({
  apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY,
  provider: new AnthropicProvider(),
});

const tools = await composio.tools.get(userId, {
  tools: ["GITHUB_GET_THE_ZEN_OF_GITHUB"],
});

const msg = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
  tools: tools,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "gimme me some zen!!",
    },
  ],
  max_tokens: 1024,
});


const result = await composio.provider.handleToolCalls(userId, msg);
console.log(result);
```

```python Python (Google) maxLines=60

```
</CodeGroup>


### Using Agentic Frameworks
Composio also has first-party support for agentic frameworks which execute tools, feed the result to the LLM and continue the conversation.



<Tip icon="info">
Here, the tool execution is handled by the agentic framework. Composio makes sure the tools are formatted into the correct objects for the agentic framework to execute.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript (Vercel) maxLines=60 wordWrap
import { Composio } from "@composio/core";
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
import { VercelProvider } from "@composio/vercel";

const tools = await composio.tools.get(userId, {
    toolkits: ["LINEAR"],
    limit: 15,
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic("claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"),
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Fetch all my projects",
    },
  ],
  tools,
  maxSteps: 5,
});

console.log(text);
```

```python Python (OpenAI Agents SDK)maxLines=60 wordWrap
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that can help with tasks."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Fetch the details of the user 'pg'"}
]

response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=messages,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
)

if response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
    tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]
    print(f"✅ Calling tool {tool_call.function.name}")
    result = composio.provider.handle_tool_call(user_id, response)
    data = json.loads(result[0])
    print(data)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Tools are scoped to a user
Each tool and tool action is scoped to a user. Hence, a `user_id` is required to fetch and execute tools.

The authentication state is checked and used while fetching and executing a tool.

For more information on authentication, see [Authenticating Tools](./authenticating-tools).

### For Humans (deterministic tool calling)
In case you just want to call a tool manually -- not using any framework or LLM provider, you can do so using the `execute` method.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript maxLines=60 wordWrap
const userId = "user@example.com";
const composio = new Composio();

const result = await composio.tools.execute("HACKERNEWS_GET_USER", {
  userId,
  arguments: {
    username: "pg",
  },
});
console.log(result);
```

```python Python maxLines=60 wordWrap

user_id = "user@example.com"
composio = Composio()

result = composio.tools.execute(
    "HACKERNEWS_GET_USER",
    user_id=user_id,
    arguments={"username": "pg"}
)
print(result)
```

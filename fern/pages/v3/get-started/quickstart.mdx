This guide covers authenticated tool calling, one of the most core features of Composio.
You will learn how to:
- Add tools to your AI agent
- Authenticate the agent/tools for a user
- Call the tools generated by the LLM

## Setup

{/* I wrote a code snippet just for visual hierarchy. This should be replaced with the authorize flow in both SDKs.  */}
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio_client import Composio
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
composio = Composio()
```
</CodeGroup>
## Authenticated tool-calling with Composio

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
task = "Get my GitHub username."

res = composio.toolkit.authorize(toolkit_slug="github", user_id="your@email.com")

print(res.redirect_url)

# Wait for the user to authorize the toolkit
composio.toolkit.wait_for_authorization(res.id)

tools = composio.tools.retrieve(tool_slug="GITHUB_GET_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER")

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    instructions="You can make anything happen!",
    input=task,
    tools=tools
)

print(response.output_text)
```
</CodeGroup>
## What just happened?

1. **Authentication Flow**: You started the authentication process with `composio.toolkit.authorize` for the GitHub toolkit and waited for user authorization.
2. **Tool Retrieval**: After authentication, you retrieved the tool definition for `GITHUB_GET_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER` with `composio.tools.retrieve`.
3. **LLM Reasoning**: The LLM received your task ("Get my GitHub username") and the available tools. It determined it needed to use the GitHub tool.
4. **Tool Execution**: OpenAI's built-in tool calling capabilities handled the execution with the authenticated tool schemas provided by Composio.

You focused on the prompt and handling the final outcome, while Composio managed the authentication, tool schemas, and API interaction.

# Initialize clients
client = OpenAI()
composio = Composio()

# Authorization flow
task = "Get my GitHub username."
res = composio.toolkit.authorize(toolkit_slug="github", user_id="your@email.com")
print(f"Please have the user visit this URL to authorize: {res.redirect_url}")

# Wait for the user to authorize the toolkit
composio.toolkit.wait_for_authorization(res.id)

# Retrieve tool definitions
tools = composio.tools.retrieve(tool_slug="GITHUB_GET_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER")

# Create completion with tools
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can use tools.",
    input=task,
    tools=tools
)

print(response.output_text)

## Next steps

This is pretty basic, but you can do more with Composio.

- Learn how to use use Composio with various model providers and SDKs using [toolsets](/docs/toolsets).
- Do [input/output processing](/docs/tool-calling/processing-tools) for tools and injecting [custom auth](/docs/auth/custom-auth).
- [Authorize](/docs/auth/introduction) tools for multiple users.

- [Executing Tools](https://docs.composio.dev/docs/executing-tools): For non-agent providers—such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI—you can process tool calls using the tool call handlers provided by the Composio SDK.
- [Authenticating Tools](https://docs.composio.dev/docs/authenticating-tools): Each toolkit comes with its own _auth config_.

subtitle: "Changes in Composio's API, SDK and more"
---

This document serves as a running changelog for Composio's V3 API and SDK. We track all changes to Composio's V3 API and SDK, including migration guides, rollout schedules, deprecations, and more.

## Why V3?
V3 represents a significant improvement over previous versions. It offers:
- **Enhanced Performance**: Faster response times and improved stability, especially for tool calls and triggers
- **More Intuitive**: Streamlines interfaces for easier integration.
- **Greater Robustness**: Significantly improved error handling, suggestions and validation.

On top of this, we **implemented a major change in nomenclature** across the API and SDK.
The table below outlines the terminology changes implemented in the V3 API.

| Previous Term | New Term (V3) | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| App | Toolkit | A collection of LLM-callable tools grouped together for a specific domain or purpose |
| Action | Tool | A function that can be directly called by an LLM to perform a specific task |
| Trigger | Trigger | Event-based mechanism that initiates automated workflows |
| Integration | Auth Config | Authentication and configuration settings for a toolkit's external service connections |
| Connection | Connected Account | User's authenticated instance of an external service with active credentials |
| Entity | User | Individual account with permissions and access to the platform |
| Trigger Metadata | Trigger Instance | Specific configuration and settings for a deployed trigger in your workflow |

When migrating your code from previous versions to V3, update your references to match this new terminology. Migration guides and code examples will use these new terms exclusively.

## Rollout plan

### Current phase
- **Platform & Dashboard Implementation** - We are currently testing and implementing the V3 API on the platform and dashboard.

### Upcoming phases

2. **Beta Access** - We will make the V3 API available for beta users and testers in the coming weeks.
3. **SDK Release** - We will release Beta SDKs revamped for the new API once the V3 API stabilizes.
4. **Documentation Release** - We will make migration guides and code examples available shortly after.

<Note>The rollout plan may change based on feedback and testing results.</Note>

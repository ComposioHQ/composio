This page tracks important updates, new features, deprecations, and migration information for the Composio platform, APIs, and SDKs. Check back regularly to stay informed about the latest changes.

## Updates

Keep up-to-date with the latest releases, deprecations, and announcements.

### [2025-04-21] Deprecation: V1 Initiate Connection API

The **[`/v1/connectedAccounts`](/api-reference/v-1/connected-accounts/initiate/)** endpoint, used to start the authentication flow for connecting user accounts is deprecated as of **April 21st, 2025**. It will be fully removed by **April 28th, 2025**.

The recommended endpoint to use is [`/v2/connectedAccounts/initiateConnection`](/api-reference/v-2/connected-accounts/initiate/). Please update your applications to use the V2 endpoint immediately to avoid service interruption.

**Resources:**
*   **[V2 Initiate Connection API Reference](/api-reference/v-2/connected-accounts/initiate/)**

### [2025-04-16] Release: Experimental V3 Base SDKs

We have released experimental base SDKs for Python and Node.js that wrap the new V3 API (currently in alpha). These SDKs provide foundational access to the V3 API endpoints.

<CardGroup>
    <Card title="Experimental V3 Python SDK" href="https://pypi.org/project/composio-client/" icon="fa-brands fa-python">
        Install via pip:
        ```bash
        pip install composio-client
        ```
    </Card>
    <Card title="Experimental V3 Node.js SDK" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@composio/client" icon="fa-brands fa-node-js">
        Install via npm:
        ```bash
        npm install @composio/client
        ```
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
These are **foundational SDKs**. More developer-friendly core SDKs and framework-specific integrations (like Langchain, OpenAI Assistants) built on V3 are coming soon! Documentation for these SDKs will follow shortly.
</Note>

### [2025-04-10] Deprecation: V1/V2 Log APIs

The **V1/V2 Action Log APIs** (endpoints for fetching historical action execution logs) are now deprecated as of **April 10th, 2025**. They have been replaced by the enhanced **V3 Logs API**.

Endpoints deprecated:
*   **V1 Action Log APIs:** [`/v1/logs`](/api-reference/v-1/logs/get-logs)
*   **V2 Action Log API:** [`/v2/actions/logs/all/`](/api-reference/v-1/action-v-2-logs/)

Please update your applications to use the new **V3 Logs API** to leverage improved logging, tracing capabilities, and ensure continued functionality.

**Resources:**
*   **[V3 Logs API Reference](/api-reference/v-3/logs/)** - *Start migration here.*
*   Contact us via [Discord](https://dub.composio.dev/discord) or [tech@composio.dev](mailto:tech@composio.dev) for assistance.

## V3 API Migration Overview

This section provides high-level context about the ongoing migration to Composio's V3 API infrastructure. Specific V3-related releases or deprecations will be announced in the **Updates** section above.

### Why V3?
V3 represents a significant improvement over previous versions. It offers:
- **Enhanced Performance**: Faster response times and improved stability, especially for tool calls and triggers.
- **More Intuitive**: Streamlined interfaces for easier integration.
- **Greater Robustness**: Significantly improved error handling, suggestions, and validation.
- **Simpler Developer Experience**: Incorporates user feedback to make the API more user-friendly.

### V3 Terminology Changes
As part of V3, we are standardizing our terminology. Please familiarize yourself with these changes:

| Previous Term | New Term (V3) | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| App | Toolkit | A collection of LLM-callable tools grouped together for a specific domain or purpose. |
| Action | Tool | A function that can be directly called by an LLM to perform a specific task. |
| Integration | Auth Config | Authentication and configuration settings for a toolkit's external service connections. |
| Connection | Connected Account | User's authenticated instance of an external service with active credentials. |
| Entity | User | Individual account with permissions and access to the platform. |
| Trigger | Trigger Types | The available triggers for a user on a specific toolkit. |
| Trigger Metadata | Trigger Instance | Specific configuration and settings for a deployed trigger in your workflow. |

Future V3 documentation and migration guides will use these new terms.

### V1/V2 API Support
<Card
    title="V1/V2 APIs Remain Supported"
    icon="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"
    iconPosition="left"
>
    We will continue supporting V1/V2 APIs and their corresponding SDKs for the foreseeable future. Existing integrations will continue to work, and we will provide ample notice (minimum two months) before any V1/V2 deprecations occur.
</Card>

### General Rollout Plan for V3
Our V3 rollout is phased to ensure a smooth transition:
1.  **Frontend Implementation:** Our dashboard (`app.composio.dev`) is already running on V3 APIs.
2.  **Beta API Access:** The V3 API will be available for beta users soon.
3.  **Beta SDK Release:** Foundational V3 SDKs are now available (see Updates feed). Core and framework-specific SDKs will follow.
4.  **Stable SDK Release (LSE):** Once stable, V3 SDKs become primary.
5.  **V1/V2 Deprecation:** Deprecation timeline (min. 2 months notice) announced after V3 SDK LSE.

<Note>The rollout plan is subject to change based on feedback and testing results.</Note>

We welcome feedback on the V3 changes: [GitHub RFC Issue #1523](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/issues/1523)

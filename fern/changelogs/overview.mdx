## Deprecations

<Warning title="Deprecated: V1/V2 Log APIs">
  The **V1/V2 Action Log APIs** (endpoints for fetching historical action execution logs) are now deprecated and have been replaced by the **V3 Logs API**.

  This is part of our migration to the enhanced V3 API infrastructure. Please transition to the new **V3 Logs API** for improved logging and tracing capabilities to avoid disruption.

  **Resources:**
  *   **V3 Logs API Reference:** [`/api-reference/api-reference/v-3/logs/`](/api-reference/api-reference/v-3/logs/) - *Start migration here.*
  *   [V3 General API Reference](/api-reference/api-reference/v-3/)
  *   Contact us via [Discord](https://dub.composio.dev/discord) or [tech@composio.dev](mailto:tech@composio.dev) for assistance.

<Note>
These are foundational SDKs that wrap the V3 API (in alpha). 

More developer-friendly core sdks + framework-specific sdks are coming soon!

Expect docs to follow soon.

## V3 API Migration (Ongoing)

This section details the ongoing migration to Composio's V3 API.

### Why V3?
V3 represents a significant improvement over previous versions. It offers:
- **Enhanced Performance**: Faster response times and improved stability, especially for tool calls and triggers
- **More Intuitive**: Streamlines interfaces for easier integration.
- **Greater Robustness**: Significantly improved error handling, suggestions and validation.
- **Simpler Developer Experience**: Takes into account the feedback from our users and makes the API more user-friendly.

On top of this, we **implemented a major change in nomenclature** across the API (Coming soon in the SDK).
The table below outlines the terminology changes implemented in the V3 API.

| Previous Term | New Term (V3) | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| App | Toolkit | A collection of LLM-callable tools grouped together for a specific domain or purpose |
| Action | Tool | A function that can be directly called by an LLM to perform a specific task |
| Integration | Auth Config | Authentication and configuration settings for a toolkit's external service connections |
| Connection | Connected Account | User's authenticated instance of an external service with active credentials |
| Entity | User | Individual account with permissions and access to the platform |
| Trigger | Trigger Types | The available triggers for a user on a specific toolkit |
| Trigger Metadata | Trigger Instance | Specific configuration and settings for a deployed trigger in your workflow |

When migrating your code from previous versions to V3, update your references to match this new terminology. Migration guides and code examples will use these new terms exclusively.

    We will provide ample notice and support before deprecating the old APIs.

    We will be supporting V1/V2 APIs and corresponding SDKs for the foreseeable future, and they will still work in production and have full backwards compatability with new API surface.

### General rollout plan
1. **Frontend Implementation** - As of right now, our dashboard is running on V3 APIs. This phase allows us to gather information about performance and see how the api works in a controlled environment.
2. **Beta Access** - We will make the V3 API available for beta users and testers in the coming week.
3. **SDK Release** - We will release Beta SDKs revamped for the new API once the V3 API stabilizes.
4. **LSE Release** - We will work towards stabilizing the new SDKs that power V3 APIs and get them to a stable release - at which time they will become our primary SDKs. We will still be supporting the old SDKs at this time.
5. **Deprecations** - We will deprecate the old APIs and SDKs after the LSE release, with two months of notice before finally discontinuing them.

<Note>The rollout plan may change based on feedback and testing results.</Note>

We have opened an issue as an RFC for comment on changes here: https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/issues/1523

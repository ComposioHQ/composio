# Glossary

This glossary provides clear definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout
the Composio documentation. Understanding these terms will help you better navigate
our platform and documentation.

## A

### Action
A specific operation or function within a tool that accomplishes a defined task. Actions are the
fundamental building blocks of tool functionality in Composio. For example, sending an email
or creating a GitHub issue would be actions.

### Advanced Search
A powerful feature of the `find_actions_by_use_case` method that enables sophisticated searching 
for multiple tools needed to accomplish complex tasks. This mode helps AI agents identify 
combinations of tools that might be required for multi-step operations.

### API Key
A secure authentication token used to identify and authorize requests to the Composio API.
Keep this key confidential as it grants access to your Composio resources.

### Apps
Third-party services or platforms that Composio integrates with, such as GitHub, Gmail, 
Slack, or Notion. Each app provides specific functionality that can be accessed through 
Composio's tools and actions.

## C

### Connection
An authenticated link between an entity (user) and a specific external service through
an integration. Connections represent successful authorization to access a service on 
behalf of a user and store necessary credentials securely.

### Custom Tools
User-defined tools created within the Composio platform that extend functionality beyond
the pre-built tools. These can be created using the `@action` decorator in Python,
`createAction` in JavaScript, or by uploading OpenAPI specifications.

## E

### Entity
A representation of a unique user or service account in the Composio ecosystem. An entity 
serves as a secure container that holds all the third-party service connections and 
permissions for a single user.

## H

### Hosted Tools
Pre-built, maintained tools that Composio provides out-of-the-box, giving developers 
instant access to thousands of actions across hundreds of integrated apps. These tools 
are regularly updated and managed by the Composio team.

## I

### Integration
A configuration object that defines how Composio connects to an external service. 
It encapsulates authentication methods, permission scopes, and API specifications
that determine how an AI agent can interact with the service.

## L

### LLM (Large Language Model)
An artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of 
understanding and generating human-like text. Composio enhances LLMs with tool-calling 
capabilities, allowing them to perform real-world actions.

### LLM Framework
A software framework designed to work with large language models. Composio provides
seamless integration with popular frameworks including:
- LangChain
- Autogen
- OpenAI
- CrewAI

### Local Tools
Tools that execute within a developer's environment, such as file operations or custom
business logic, without requiring external API calls. These tools run in isolated
workspaces for security and consistency.

## P

### Postprocessing
A powerful feature that transforms tool outputs after execution but before returning 
results to the LLM. This enables data filtering, formatting, and optimization to reduce 
token usage and improve response quality.

### Preprocessing
A handler that modifies or validates parameters before a tool call is executed. This
improves reliability by ensuring correct input formatting and reduces LLM hallucination
by validating parameters.

## S

### Schema Processing
A sophisticated handler that customizes how tools are presented to LLMs by modifying 
the tool schema, description, or parameters. This gives developers fine-grained control 
over how LLMs interact with tools.

## T

### Tool
A modular component in Composio that provides specific functionality through a
defined interface. Tools can be:
- Hosted (pre-built by Composio)
- Local (run in your environment)
- Custom (created by developers)

### Tool Calling
The process where an LLM intelligently selects and uses appropriate tools to accomplish 
tasks. This includes:
- Tool selection based on task requirements
- Parameter preparation and validation
- Result handling and processing

### Tool Registry
A centralized repository where tools are registered, versioned, and managed
within Composio. The registry ensures tool discoverability and version control.

### Toolset
A collection of tools managed through the ComposioToolSet class in the SDK. Toolsets
can combine multiple types of tools (hosted, local, and custom) into a unified interface.

### Trigger
An event-based mechanism that monitors specific activities in connected apps and notifies
your AI agents in real-time via webhooks or websockets. Triggers enable reactive
automation based on external events.

## U

### Use Case Search
An intuitive method in Composio for discovering tools based on the task you want to 
accomplish. This natural language search helps developers find relevant tools without 
knowing exact tool names or specifications.

## W

### Webhook
A real-time HTTP callback mechanism that delivers notifications about events in Composio
to external systems. Webhooks enable asynchronous communication and event-driven
architectures.

### White-Labelling
The ability to customize Composio's appearance, branding, and user interface elements
to match your application's look and feel, creating a seamless user experience.

### Workspace
An isolated execution environment for local tools. Composio supports multiple workspace types:
- Host: Direct machine execution
- Docker: Containerized environments
- E2B: Serverless execution
- Fly.io: Edge computing deployment

Each workspace type offers different benefits for security, scalability, and deployment.

## Tools and Tool Calling

### What is tool calling in Composio?
Tool calling is a powerful capability that allows language models (LLMs) to interact with 
external systems through structured function calls. This transforms AI assistants from 
purely conversational systems into action-oriented tools that can:
- Access real-world data and services
- Perform specific tasks and operations
- Integrate with existing systems
- Execute complex workflows

### How many tools does Composio offer?
Composio provides a growing library of pre-built tools:
- 500+ hosted tools across various applications
- 100+ common integrations with popular services
- Dozens of local utility tools
- Unlimited custom tool creation capability

The tool library is continuously expanding based on user needs and partner integrations.

### Can I create my own custom tools in Composio?
Yes! Composio offers multiple ways to create custom tools:

1. Using the `@action` decorator in Python:
   ```python
   @action
   def my_custom_tool(param1: str, param2: int) -> dict:
       # Your custom logic here
       return {"result": "success"}
   ```

2. Using the `createAction` method in JavaScript:
   ```javascript
   const myTool = createAction({
     name: "myCustomTool",
     parameters: {...},
     handler: async (params) => {
       // Your custom logic here
     }
   });
   ```

3. Uploading OpenAPI specifications through the Custom Tools Dashboard
4. Using the Tools API to programmatically create and manage tools

### How do I find the right tools for my use case?
Composio provides several ways to discover relevant tools:

1. Use the `find_actions_by_use_case` method:
   ```python
   tools = toolset.find_actions_by_use_case(
       "Send an email and create a calendar event"
   )
   ```

2. Browse the [Tools Directory](/tools) by:
   - Application category
   - Functionality tags
   - Most popular tools
   - Recently added tools

3. Search directly in the Composio dashboard
4. Use the API to programmatically search for tools

### Can I combine different types of tools?
Yes! Composio is designed for seamless tool integration. You can freely mix and match:
- Hosted tools (pre-built by Composio)
- Local tools (running in your environment)
- Custom tools (created by your team)

All tools work together through a unified interface, regardless of their type or origin.

## Authentication and Security

### How does authentication work with Composio?
Composio provides a secure, flexible authentication system:

1. **For Development/Testing:**
   - Use Composio's client credentials
   - Quick setup for prototyping
   - Rate-limited but sufficient for testing

2. **For Production:**
   - Configure your own developer app credentials
   - Higher rate limits
   - Custom OAuth configuration
   - Enhanced security options

### What's the difference between an integration and a connection?
Understanding this distinction is crucial:

**Integration:**
- Configuration template for connecting to a service
- Defines authentication methods and scopes
- Specifies API endpoints and parameters
- Created once per application

**Connection:**
- Actual authenticated link to a service
- Contains user-specific credentials
- Represents active access to the service
- Created for each user/entity

### Can my users authenticate with their own accounts?
Yes! Composio's entity and connection system supports user-specific authentication:

1. Create an entity for each user
2. Users authenticate with their own credentials
3. Connections are stored securely per entity
4. Each user maintains their own set of connections

This enables multi-user applications where each user has their own authenticated services.

### How secure is the authentication process?
Composio implements industry-standard security practices:

- Encrypted credential storage
- OAuth 2.0 compliance
- Regular security audits
- No plaintext secret storage
- Automatic token rotation
- Secure webhook endpoints

## Triggers and Real-time Events

### What are triggers in Composio?
Triggers are event monitoring systems that enable real-time reactions to changes in 
connected applications. They can:
- Monitor specific events (e.g., new emails, GitHub issues)
- Send notifications via webhooks or websockets
- Trigger AI agent responses
- Enable event-driven automation

### How do I set up a webhook for triggers?
Setting up webhooks involves these steps:

1. Configure a public endpoint (URL) for receiving events
2. Register the webhook in Composio:
   ```python
   webhook = composio.register_webhook(
       url="https://your-domain.com/webhook",
       events=["email.received", "github.issue.created"]
   )
   ```
3. Handle incoming webhook payloads in your application

For local development, you can use tools like ngrok or localtunnel to expose local endpoints.

### Can Composio triggers work with any external service?
Triggers are available for most integrated apps in Composio. To check availability:

1. Use the dashboard to browse trigger-enabled services
2. Call the `get_trigger` method:
   ```python
   available_triggers = service.get_trigger()
   ```
3. Check the [Triggers Documentation](/triggers) for supported events

## Workspaces and Deployment

### What are workspaces in Composio?
Workspaces are isolated environments for executing local tools. Each type offers different benefits:

**Host Workspace:**
- Direct machine execution
- Lowest latency
- Full system access
- Development friendly

**Docker Workspace:**
- Containerized environment
- Consistent dependencies
- Enhanced security
- Production ready

**E2B Workspace:**
- Serverless execution
- Auto-scaling
- Pay-per-use
- No infrastructure management

**Fly.io Workspace:**
- Edge computing
- Global distribution
- Low latency
- High availability

### Why would I use a Docker workspace instead of the Host workspace?
Docker workspaces offer several advantages:

1. **Security:**
   - Isolated execution environment
   - Limited system access
   - Resource constraints

2. **Consistency:**
   - Identical environment across systems
   - Predictable behavior
   - Dependency management

3. **Deployment:**
   - Easy scaling
   - Container orchestration
   - Cloud-native compatibility

## Technical Details

### How do I handle tool call responses from LLMs?
Composio provides robust tools for handling LLM responses:

```python
# Python
result = await toolset.handle_tool_calls(
    llm_response,
    max_retries=3,
    error_handler=my_error_handler
)
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
const result = await toolset.handleToolCall(
  llmResponse,
  {
    maxRetries: 3,
    errorHandler: myErrorHandler
  }
);
```

### Can I modify tool schemas or parameters before they're sent to an LLM?
Yes, through schema processing:

```python
def modify_schema(schema: dict) -> dict:
    schema["description"] = "Enhanced " + schema["description"]
    return schema

tool.add_schema_processor(modify_schema)
```

This enables fine-tuned control over how tools are presented to LLMs.

### How can I optimize token usage with tool responses?
Implement postprocessing to optimize responses:

```python
def optimize_response(response: dict) -> dict:
    # Filter unnecessary data
    # Format for token efficiency
    return filtered_response

tool.add_postprocessor(optimize_response)
```

### Does Composio support asynchronous programming?
Yes, both SDKs fully support async/await:

```python
# Python
async def my_async_function():
    result = await tool.execute(params)
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  const result = await tool.execute(params);
}
```

This enables integration with modern asynchronous applications and frameworks.

**Composio** enables your **PraisonAI agents** to **connect** with many **tools**!

<Tip>Goal: Star a repository on GitHub with natural language & PraisonAI Agent</Tip>

### Install Packages & Connect a Tool

These commands prepare your environment for seamless interaction between PraisonAI and GitHub.

<CodeGroup>
    ``` bash Run command
    pip install PraisonAI -q
    pip install composio-praisonai
    # login to composio
    composio login
    # Connect your GitHub using command below, so agents can use it. 
    composio add github
    # Check all different apps which you can connect with
    composio apps
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Goal: Use PraisonAI Agent to Interact with Github using Composio

<Steps>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

Prepare your environment by initializing necessary imports from PraisonAI and setting up your client.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Default Imports
    import os
    import yaml
    from praisonai import PraisonAI

    from composio_praisonai import Action, ComposioToolSet
    ```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Write the Praison-supported Composio Tools in `tools.py` file.">

This step involves fetching and integrating GitHub tools provided by Composio, and writing them in PraisonAI supported Format, returning the name of tools in a format, that should be added to `agents.yml` file.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Write the tools
    composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()
    tools = composio_toolset.get_tools(
        actions=[Action.GITHUB_ACTIVITY_STAR_REPO_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER]
    )
    tool_section_str = composio_toolset.get_tools_section(tools)
    print(tool_section_str)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Define the `agents.yml` either in a separate file, or in your script.">

This step involves configuring and executing the agent to carry out actions, such as starring a GitHub repository.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Define agent.yml
    agent_yaml = """
    framework: "crewai"
    topic: "Github Management"

    roles:
      developer:
        role: "Developer"
        goal: "An expert programmer"
        backstory: "A developer exploring new codebases and having certain tools available to execute different tasks."
        tasks:
          star_github:
            description: "Star a repo composiohq/composio on GitHub"
            expected_output: "Response whether the task was executed."
    """ + tool_section_str

    print(agent_yaml)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>


<Step title="Run the PraisonAI Agents to execute the goal/task.">

Here you initialize PraisonAI class, and execute.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Define agent.yml
    # Create a PraisonAI instance with the agent_yaml content
    praison_ai = PraisonAI(agent_yaml=agent_yaml)

    # Run PraisonAI
    result = praison_ai.main()

    # Print the result
    print(result)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
</Steps>

title: Composio MCP with Cursor
---

This guide covers installation, authentication flows, and troubleshooting for MCP tools in Cursor.

## Installation

1. **Check Node.js Installation**
    - Make sure Node.js is installed on your system by running:
        
        ```bash
        node -v
        ```
        
    - If Node.js is not installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    - **Note**: For best results, use Node.js 10 or higher. We don't support earlier versions.
2. **Install MCP Tools**
    - Paste the `npx` command generated by [mcp.composio.dev](http://mcp.composio.dev/) into your terminal:
        
        ```bash
        # Example:
        Your generated code
        ```
        
    - This command installs the MCP tools and configures them for use in Cursor.
3. **Verify Installation**
    - Open Cursor settings and navigate to **MCP** to confirm the MCP servers are installed.
    - If everything looks correct, you can start using MCP features directly in Cursor.

## Authentication Methods

Composio MCP supports two authentication methods:

### OAuth Authentication

1. **Connection Check:**
Ask the LLM if there is any active connection with the said app.
2. **Initiate Connection:**
If no active connection exists, ask the LLM to initiate a connection.
3. **Complete Authentication:**
Click the provided authentication link and complete the OAuth flow in your browser.
4. **Execute Actions:**
Once authenticated, the LLM can execute authorized actions.

### API Key Authentication

1. **Connection Verification:**
Ask the LLM if there is any active connection with the said app.
2. **Initiate Connection:**
If no active connection exists, ask the LLM to initiate a connection.
3. **Request API Key:**
The LLM initiates a connection and prompts for your API key.
4. **Enter Credentials:**
Paste your API key when prompted in the chat interface.
    
    <Note>
    API key entry will be streamlined in future updates.
    </Note>
     
5. Execute actions
After successful authentication, the tool is ready for use.

### 1. Missing Authentication Link

If the authentication link doesn't appear in chat:

- Explicitly request the link by asking: "Connect to [App name] first and output the auth link."
- Or specify: "Run COMPOSIO_INITIATE_CONNECTION for [App name] and output the auth link"

### 2. Connection Verification Issues

If the LLM skips connection verification and starts executing tools:

- Manually request connection initiation: "Run COMPOSIO_INITIATE_CONNECTION for [app name] and provide the authentication link."

Important: We are actively working on improving the tool execution flow. These troubleshooting steps are temporary solutions to help you get started.

## Best Practices

For optimal performance and reliability, follow these recommended practices when using MCP tools in Cursor:

- **Limit MCP Servers:**
    - To ensure stable connectivity and proper functionality, connect **no more than 3 MCP servers simultaneously**. Connecting more than 3 servers may result in authentication issues or connection failures.

<Warning>
Connecting more than the recommended number of MCP servers can lead to unexpected behavior. Adhering to these best practices will help you get the most out of MCP tools in Cursor.
</Warning>

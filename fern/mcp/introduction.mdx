title: Composio MCP Servers
---
Composio MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers provide a powerful way to expose and integrate tools from various applications, making them accessible to any compatible MCP client or SDK. This creates a seamless bridge between your tools and AI agents, enabling rich, interactive functionality across your ecosystem.

To learn about the MCP clients, see the [clients](/mcp/clients) page.
To build with agents, one can customize the MCP server too.

## Creating Custom MCP Servers
<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Authentication">
    - **Configure app permissions:**
      Select the specific scopes and permissions your integration requires for each connected application. This ensures your MCP server has the right level of access.

    - **Customize the authentication experience (Optional):**
      Create a seamless, branded experience by providing your own OAuth credentials and customizing the consent screens.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and configure an MCP server">
    Making the following request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3/mcp/servers \
      -H "x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "Gmail",
        "apps": [
          "gmail"
        ],
        "auth_config_id": {}
      }'
    ```
    The response looks like:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "5bc757cc-7a8e-431c-8616-7f57cbed2423",
      "name": "gdrive_searcher",
      "auth_config_id": "a8a244c4-4a52-488e-8a01-2e504d069d16",
      "allowed_tools": [
        "GOOGLEDRIVE_FIND_FILE",
        "GOOGLEDRIVE_FIND_FOLDER",
        "GOOGLEDRIVE_DOWNLOAD_FILE"
      ],
      "mcp_url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/composio/server/5bc757cc-7a8e-431c-8616-7f57cbed2423?transport=sse",
      "commands": {
        "cursor": "npx @composio/mcp@latest setup \"<mcp_url>\" --client cursor",
        "claude":  "npx @composio/mcp@latest setup \"<mcp_url>\" --client claude",
        "windsurf": "npx @composio/mcp@latest setup \"<mcp_url>\" --client windsurf"
      },
      "created_at": "2025-05-18T22:15:25.926Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-05-18T22:15:25.926Z"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Client applications connect to the server">
    The resultant `mcp_url`; (`https://mcp.composio.dev/composio/server/<UUID>?transport=sse`) is used by the client applications to connect to the server.  
    The URL accepts three optional query parameters:

| Query param | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `user_id` | Bind the session to a user identifier from your app. |
| `connected_account_id` | Pin the session to a specific Composio `connectedAccount` (skip account selection). |
| `include_composio_helper_actions=true` | Inject helper tools so the agent can walk the user through authentication when needed. |

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Currently, the default transport is `sse`. Support for `transport=http-stream` will be available soon.

### Configuring authentication
You or your users need to authenticate against an app to use it's MCP server through Composio!
This can be done in two ways:

* Authenticate users upfront via the Composio SDK/API. Follow [this guide](/auth/connection) to learn how to connect users. This is recommended for most use cases
* Let the agent authenticate users on demand. Passing `include_composio_helper_actions=true` in the URL will include Composio's helper actions and the agent will guide the user through auth on demand.

title: Composio MCP with Windsurf
---

This guide covers installation, authentication flows, and troubleshooting for MCP tools in Windsurf IDE.

## Installation

1. **Check NodeJS Installation**
    - Verify NodeJS is installed on your system: `node -v`
    
    - If not installed, download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    
2. **Install MCP Tools**
    - Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npx composio-core@rc mcp "https://mcp.composio.dev/notion/RANDOM_SUFFIX" --client windsurf
    ```

3. **Verify Installation**
    - After running the command, restart Windsurf to start using the integration.

## Authentication Methods

Composio MCP supports two authentication methods:

### OAuth Authentication

1. **Connection Check:**
Ask the LLM if there is any active connection with the said app.
2. **Initiate Connection:**
If no active connection exists, ask the LLM to initiate a connection.
3. **Complete Authentication:**
Click the provided authentication link and complete the OAuth flow in your browser.
4. **Execute Actions:**
Once authenticated, the LLM can execute authorized actions.

### API Key Authentication

1. **Connection Verification:**
Ask the LLM if there is any active connection with the said app.
2. **Initiate Connection:**
If no active connection exists, ask the LLM to initiate a connection.
3. **Request API Key:**
The LLM initiates a connection and prompts for your API key.
4. **Enter Credentials:**
Paste your API key when prompted in the chat interface.
    
    <Note>
    API key entry will be streamlined in future updates.
    </Note>
    
5. Execute actions
After successful authentication, the tool is ready for use.

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting">

### 1. Missing Authentication Link

If the authentication link doesn't appear in chat:

- Explicitly request the link by asking: "Connect to [App name] first and output the auth link."
- Or specify: "Run COMPOSIO_INITIATE_CONNECTION for [App name] and output the auth link"

### 2. Connection Verification Issues

If the LLM skips connection verification and starts executing tools:

- Manually request connection initiation: "Run COMPOSIO_INITIATE_CONNECTION for [app name] and provide the authentication link."

We are actively working on improving the tool execution flow. These troubleshooting steps are temporary solutions to help you get started.

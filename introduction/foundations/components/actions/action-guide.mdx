## Using Actions

**Prerequisite**: Successfully **linking an account** & then having `connectedAccountId`.

Actions are tasks which your agent can perform. Actions can be performed on the tools which are integrated. Some examples of actions: 
* Create a Google Calendar Event 
* Fetch all the Subtitles of a Youtube Video 
* Send an email
* Star a github repo, etc.

Check out the coding guides provided in the examples section to have a better understanding.

## **Types of Actions**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default Actions">
    Composio supports a variety of default actions for each supported
    application.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Actions">
    Our platform offers an extensible interface for defining custom actions for
    both custom and default applications. [Learn
    more.](https://app.composio.dev/apps/custom)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Code/Local Actions">
    Composio enables fetching authentication parameters for any connection,
    allowing you to execute code remotely and interact with API endpoints.
    Example: Use the `getConnection` endpoint to call GitHub, create an issue on
    your server, and fetch the access token. [Learn

## Working with Actions

<Steps>
<Step title="Fetch Actions">

<CodeGroup>
```python Get Action/s Input Schema

from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, Action

tool_set = ComposioToolSet()

tools = tool_set.get_actions(actions=[Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE])

print(tools)
```
</CodeGroup>

The response will include the **Action's ID, Name and Input/Output schema** in **JSON Def**

<CodeGroup>
```JSON Sample Response
[
  {
    "name": "github_create_issue",
    "display_name": "Create Issue",
    "description": "Create a new issue in a repository.",
    "parameters": {
      "properties": {
        "owner": {
          "description": "Owner of the repository",
          "examples": [
            "openai",
            "facebook"
          ],
          "title": "Owner",
          "type": "string"
        }...
      },
      "required": [
        "owner"...
      ],
      "title": "CreateIssueRequest",
      "type": "object"
    },
    "response": {
      "properties": {
        ...
      }
    },
    "appId": "46f40473-cc29-4b52-98e0-a812ff2b44e3",
    "appKey": "github",
    "logo": "https://i.imgur.com/FAXkSDq.png",
    "appName": "Github",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Execute the action">
<CodeGroup>
```python Execute Action

from composio import ComposioToolSet, Action

tool_set = ComposioToolSet(api_key="COMPOSIO_API_KEY")

tool_set.execute_action(
    action=Action.SLACK_CHAT_POST_MESSAGE,
    params={"text": "Hello, world!", "channel": "D04N8SVQKKU"},
    entity_id="melissa",
)
```
</CodeGroup>
When executed successfully, action's response will be output. Output schema as returned by the /actions endpoint.
</Step>

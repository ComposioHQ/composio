Your debugging info is tied to your project and it helps us trace what happened and debug the issue faster.

## Finding Your Debugging Info

Navigate to your project settings to find your debugging information:

## What to Share

When reaching out for support, share these identifiers:

```
@project_id: pr_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
@org_id: ok_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
@org_member_email: your-email@example.com
```

The identifiers with `pr_` (project) and `ok_` (organization) prefixes let us quickly check your logs inside our internal tracing tools, helping us resolve issues faster.

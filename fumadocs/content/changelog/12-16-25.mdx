title: "Deprecation of is_local_toolkit Field and Removal of is_local Query Parameter"

We're cleaning up the Toolkits API by deprecating the `is_local_toolkit` response field and removing the `is_local` query parameter filter.

### What's Changing?

#### Response Field: `is_local_toolkit` (Deprecated)

The `is_local_toolkit` field in toolkit API responses is now **deprecated**. This field was originally intended to indicate whether a toolkit was local to a specific project, but it is no longer meaningful as no toolkits use this classification.

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v3/toolkits` - List toolkits
- `GET /api/v3/toolkits/{slug}` - Get single toolkit
- `GET /api/v3/toolkits/multi` - Get multiple toolkits

The field will continue to be returned in API responses for backward compatibility, but it will always return `false`. It is marked as `deprecated: true` in the OpenAPI specification.

#### Query Parameter: `is_local` (Removed)

The `is_local` query parameter filter has been **removed** from the following endpoints:
- `GET /api/v3/toolkits`
- `GET /api/v3/toolkits/multi`

This parameter was used to filter toolkits by their local status, but since no toolkits are classified as local, it served no practical purpose.

### Impact on Your Code

#### If You're Using the `is_local` Query Parameter

**Before:**
```typescript
// This will no longer work
const toolkits = await fetch('/api/v3/toolkits?is_local=true');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Simply remove the is_local parameter
const toolkits = await fetch('/api/v3/toolkits');
```

#### If You're Reading the `is_local_toolkit` Response Field

The field will continue to be present in responses but will always return `false`. You can safely ignore this field or remove any logic that depends on it.

**Before:**
```typescript
const toolkit = await composio.toolkits.get('github');
if (toolkit.is_local_toolkit) {
  // This condition will never be true
  handleLocalToolkit(toolkit);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const toolkit = await composio.toolkits.get('github');
// Remove is_local_toolkit checks - they're no longer meaningful
```

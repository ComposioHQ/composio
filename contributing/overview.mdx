## 🥾 Choose your adventure

There _so_ many ways to contribute to Mage! We welcome all contributions, no matter how small. 

Start your contribution journey below, whether you're an *apprentice* or a *master of spells*. Once you feel confident in your path, [read on](/contributing/development-environment) to learn how to get started.

Thanks for leading the charge! The easiest way to contribute is to report bugs or suggest new features.

### Report bugs

Head on over to our [Slack](https://mage.ai/chat) and let us know what's up. We recommend the `#bugs-troubleshoot-questions` channel.

### Squash bugs

We're always trying to make our project better, but we need your help! Take a look at our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/issues) for small to medium complexity projects and bugs that need fixing.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="🤹 Loremaster">
### Suggest new features
We _love_ your suggestions. First take a look at our [roadmap](/about/roadmap) to see if your idea is already planned. You might also consider checking out open issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai).

Otherwise, drop a line in our [Slack](https://mage.ai/chat) and let us know what you're thinking. We recommend the `#feature-requests` channel.

### Write documentation
We have _a lot_ of docs. We really hope they're fun to read, but we know they can be improved. 

The great news is that they're fun to write, too! The _easiest_ way to contribute is by scrolling to the bottom of the page you'd like to edit (maybe this one) and clicking the "Edit this page" link. You'll be taken to GitHub where you can make your changes and submit a pull request.

If you like working in code, that's great too! All of our docs are written in markdown, so you can just pull Mage from [GitHub](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai) and start writing.

### Community Support

If you're already an adept Mager, we need your help! We're looking for community members to help answer questions in our [Slack](https://mage.ai/chat). Check out the `#bugs-troubleshoot-questions`, `#general`, and `#feature-requests` channels to get started. Anything helps!

If you want to take it up a notch, check out our GitHub issues! We have a lot of [open issues](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/issues) that need your help.

### Backend development

We're always looking for help with the Mage backend— that might look like refactoring code, adding new features, or fixing bugs.

[Here's](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/pull/3497) an example of an _amazing_ backend PR that drastically improved dbt functionality in Mage. 

Check out our [roadmap](https://airtable.com/shrJctaGt4tvU27uF/tbl5bIlFkk2KhCpL4) for small to large complexity projects that need your help!

### Data integration

Mage supports [data integration](/data-integrations/overview) pipelines via the Singer spec. We're always looking for help adding/updating our sources and destinations. 

Here's an example of a [great community PR](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/pull/2277) & here's our [docs on adding a source](/contributing/data-integrations/adapt-existing-source).

### IO operations (SQL block) and templates

Want to help build _awesome_ tools _inside_ the pipeline builder page? Help out with our IO operations by adding new SQL blocks! Here's a PR that implements a [DuckDB IO Class](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/pull/3463).

The simplest way you can help is by adding data loader/exporter templates. Here's an example PR that adds a few for [DuckDB](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/pull/3553).

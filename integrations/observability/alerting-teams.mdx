## Set up webhooks for Teams

Follow these
[instructions on Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook)
to setup incoming webhooks for your workspace.

---

## Update Mage project settings

Once you’ve set up webhooks for Teams, you should have a webhook URL that Teams
provides.

Here is an example webhook (yours may vary):

```
https://teams.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/B04XXXXGY67/IncomingWebhook/1UgUkao8pXXXXPmsuXXXX2lk
```

Follow these steps to add that webhook URL to your project settings:

1. Open the Mage tool in your browser (e.g. http://localhost:6789/).
2. Open a pipeline and start editing it (e.g.
   http://localhost:6789/pipelines/example_pipeline/edit).
3. In your left sidebar in the file browser, scroll all the way down and click
   on a file named `metadata.yaml`.
4. In the `metadata.yaml` file, add a section with the following
   configuration or update the existing `notification_config` section:

    ```yaml
    notification_config:
      alert_on:
        - trigger_failure
        - trigger_passed_sla
    ```

    If you omit the `alert_on` section it will default to `trigger_failure` and `trigger_passed_sla`.

    Options:

    - `trigger_failure`: alert when a run of a trigger fails
    - `trigger_success`: alert when a run of a trigger succeeds
    - `trigger_passed_sla`: alert when a run of a trigger passes sla

5. In the `metadata.yaml` file, add the following values:

    ```yaml
    notification_config:
      alert_on:
        ...
      teams_config:
        webhook_url: 'https://teams.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/B04XXXXGY67/IncomingWebhook/1UgUkao8pXXXXPmsuXXXX2lk'
    ```

    Change the `webhook_url` value to be the webhook URL you created from Teams.

---

## What next?

Whenever a pipeline run is successfully completed or fails, a Teams message will
appear in the channel you configured the webhook URL for.

Here is an example of what that message could look like:

|                                                                                                        |

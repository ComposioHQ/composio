## API gotchas

-   When setting up a GitHub App:
    - The App ID is made of numbers (e.g. 401953)
    - The App Public Link is the URL to your Github App public page (e.g. https://github.com/apps/nango-github-app)
    - The App Private Key needs to be generated in your GitHub App settings and starts with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` (not to be confused with the Client Secrets)
    - The Setup URL (displayed on your Nango integration page) needs to be added to your GitHub App configuration (not to be confused with the Callback URL that can stay empty)
-   There are certain API methods that only work with an OAuth App that will not work with an App. Please check the Github documentation and look for a "Works with Github Apps" header under the endpoint.
-   The `github-app-oauth` is a combination of a Github App and OAuth and should be used when a Github App would need approval to be installed into an organization.
-   Nango supports initiating a connection with a GitHub App using the frontend SDK, but not directly from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). Therefore, you should encourage users to install your GitHub App from your product, rather than from the GitHub Marketplace directly. This is a limitation we plan to fix in the future.

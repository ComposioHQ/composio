## Receive webhooks on data updates

Receive webhooks from Nango when new records are available ([step-by-step guide](/integrate/guides/receive-webhooks-from-nango)).

## Response

<Tip>
This endpoint returns a list of records, ordered by modification date ascending. If some records are updated while you paginate through this endpoint, you might see these records multiple times.
</Tip>

### Default behaviour
By default this returns an array of objects in the data model that you queried with some metadata about each record.

```json
{ 
    records: 
        [
            {
                id: 123,
                ..., // Fields as specified in the model you queried
                _nango_metadata: {
                    deleted_at: null,
                    last_action: 'ADDED',
                    first_seen_at: '2023-09-18T15:20:35.941305+00:00',
                    last_modified_at: '2023-09-18T15:20:35.941305+00:00',
                    cursor: 'MjAyNC0wMy0wNFQwNjo1OTo1MS40NzE0NDEtMDU6MDB8fDE1Y2NjODA1LTY0ZDUtNDk0MC1hN2UwLTQ1ZmM3MDQ5OTdhMQ=='
                }
            },
            ...
        ],
    next_cursor: "MjAyMy0xMS0xN1QxMTo0NzoxNC40NDcrMDI6MDB8fDAzZTA1NzIxLWNiZmQtNGYxNS1iYTNhLWFlNjM2Y2MwNmEw=="
}

To trigger OAuth flows with Nango, use the [Nango frontend SDK](/reference/sdks/frontend).

## Request body

You can use this endpoint to import OAuth 2, OAuth 1, API Keys, and Basic auth credentials.

The required fields depend on the type of authentication of the _connections_ you are trying to import.

## Overview

Workspace environments facilitate **isolated** and **secure** execution of tools with **customizable configurations**. The SWE Development Kit (swekit) provides a range of environments tailored to your agents' needs, encompassing **security**, **configuration**, **CPU allocation**, and **network port access** for public services.

## Why Workspace Environments Matters?

Workspace environments are essential for:
- **Security**: Isolating execution to protect the host system and sensitive data.
- **Specific Configuration Needs**: Tailoring the environment to the requirements of different agents.
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocating specific CPU and memory resources to agents.
- **Networking**: Configuring open ports for services that need to be accessible publicly.

## Configuring Workspace Environment Variables

### Configurable Parameters

When configuring your workspace environment, consider the following customizable parameters to tailor the environment to your SWE agents' needs:

- **`GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`**: Optional. This token is used for GitHub operations. Use `export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<github_access_token>` environment variable to provide it.
- **`environment`**: Optional. A set of key-value pairs representing environment variables specific to the workspace's needs.
- **`persistent`**: A boolean flag, when set to `True`, ensures that the workspace persists beyond the execution of an agent. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want your agent to deploy a service, such as a website, and require that the service remains active and accessible after the agent's task is complete.
- **`ports`**: Optional. A dictionary specifying the port mappings for services that need to be publicly accessible. For example, if your agent is running a web server, you can map the internal port to an external one to allow public access.

These parameters empower you to customize the security, configuration, resource allocation, and networking aspects of your workspace environment, ensuring optimal conditions for your SWE agents' operation.

### Docker Environment

For enhanced security and isolation, use Docker:
<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Docker Environment
import { OpenAIToolset, Workspace } from "composio-core"

toolset = new OpenAIToolset({
    workspaceConfig: Workspace.Docker({})
})
```
</CodeGroup>

You can configure exposed ports for development:
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Opening ports on Docker for web apps
toolset = new OpenAIToolset({
  workspaceConfig: Workspace.Docker({
    ports: {
      8001: 8001,
    }
  })
})
```
</CodeGroup>
<Info>
  For more details on configuring Docker ports, refer to the [Dockerode SDK documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockerode).
</Info>

### E2B Environment

To use E2B sandboxes for cloud-based execution:
<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript E2B Environment
import { OpenAIToolset, Workspace } from "composio-core"

toolset = new OpenAIToolset({
    workspaceConfig: Workspace.E2B({})
})
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  To use E2B sandboxes, you need to set the `E2B_API_KEY` environment variable with your E2B API key.
</Warning>

## Customizing Workspace Environments Variables

You can customize the workspace environment by adding environment variables while creating workspace.
<CodeGroup>
``` javascript Add environment variables to workspace
composio_toolset = new OpenAIToolset({
    workspaceConfig: WorkspaceType.Docker({
        environment: {
            "SOME_API_TOKEN": "<SOME_API_TOKEN>",
        }
    })
})
```
</CodeGroup>

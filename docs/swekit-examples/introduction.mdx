## Overview
SWE Development Kit (swekit) is a powerful framework for building Software Engineering agents using Composio's tooling ecosystem. This example demonstrates how to build a Pull Request (PR) Review Agent using SWE Development Kit (swekit). The PR Review Agent uses Composio's tooling ecosystem to help automate and enhance the PR review process.


## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Installation">
  Begin by installing the core packages:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Installing SweKit
  pip install swekit composio-core
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  For additional functionality, install packages for your preferred framework (e.g., LangChain):
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Installing LangChain and Composio LangChain Plugin
  pip install langchain composio-langchain
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your Github Account">
  To utilize Github Issues as a task source, link your Github account as follows:
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Composio CLI">
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Use Composio CLI
  composio add github
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Locally using Github Auth Token">
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Use Github Auth Token
  export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_token>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  <Note>
  There are two ways to provide the GitHub access token for git clone:

  1. Set the environment variable `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN='<git_access_token>'`.
  2. Use the GitHub account connected to your toolset entity. However, this method has limitations:
     - The agent won't be able to push or create PRs.
     - You need to set `export ALLOW_CLONE_WITHOUT_REPO='true'`.

  Option 1 is recommended for full functionality.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a New Agent">
  Generate your agent's scaffolding:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Create a new Folder with basic PR Review agent code
  swekit scaffold pr_review -f langgraph -o pr_review_agent
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  <Note>
  Scaffold support for other frameworks coming soon!
  </Note>
  
  This process will establish a new agent at `pr_review_agent` with essential files:
  - `main.py`: The main script to execute the agent
  - `agent.py`: The agent's core definition
  - `prompts.py`: Prompts to guide the agent's actions
  - `input.py`: A helper file to take inputs from the user
  - `tools.py`: A file to add custom tools to the agent

</Step>


<Step title="Start Docker Server">
  <Warning>
  To use Docker as the default workspace environment, ensure your Docker server is running
  </Warning>
    If you prefer to run the agent locally without Docker (**Unsafe**), modify the workspace configuration in `agent.py` by setting the `WorkspaceType.Docker()` to `WorkspaceType.Host()`.
</Step>


<Step title="Run the Agent">
  To activate the agent, proceed to its directory and execute:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Run the agent
  cd pr_review_agent/agent
  python main.py
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  You will be prompted to specify the repository and issue for the agent to address.
</Step>

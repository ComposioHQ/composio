title: "Toolkit Deprecation: Removing Empty Toolkits"
date: "2025-12-22"

### What's Changed

We're deprecating **15 toolkits** that currently have no supported actions. These toolkits will be reactivated once we add functional actions to them, ensuring you only see integrations that are ready to use.

### Deprecated Toolkits

The following toolkits are now deprecated:

- `BREATHEHR`, `DIXA`, `EGNYTE`, `EXPENSIFY`, `FREEAGENT`
- `GUSTO`, `NUTSHELL`, `OPENNUTRITION`, `OYSTERHR`, `RAKUTEN`
- `SALESFLARE`, `TEAMLEADER`, `WALGREENS`, `WHOOP`, `WIX`

### Impact on Your Integration

#### API Behavior Changes

**List Toolkits Endpoint**

The [GET /toolkits](https://docs.composio.dev/rest-api/toolkits/get-toolkits) endpoint will now exclude deprecated toolkits by default.

**Need to see deprecated toolkits?** Use the `include_deprecated` query parameter.

#### Backward Compatibility

**Your existing integrations are safe.** All other endpoints continue to work with deprecated toolkits:

- Retrieve the toolkit details
- Create auth configurations
- Manage connected accounts
- Configure MCP Servers

This ensures zero breaking changes to your current implementations.

### Why This Matters

This change helps you:
- **Focus on working integrations** - No clutter from non-functional toolkits
- **Avoid integration attempts** with toolkits that have no actions
- **Better developer experience** with a cleaner, more actionable toolkit list

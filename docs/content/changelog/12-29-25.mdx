### Breaking Changes

We verified that active usage for these toolkits is practically zero before proceeding with these changes.

#### Make Toolkit
- **Removed Region field** in favor of explicit Base URL configuration
- Users must now provide the full Base URL instead of selecting a region
- This change provides more flexibility for custom deployments and regional endpoints

#### Bubble Toolkit
- **Removed Subdomain field** and restructured Base URL handling
- Users must now provide the complete Base URL instead of just the Subdomain
- This change standardizes URL configuration across all toolkits

### Deprecated Features

#### HelloBar Toolkit
- **Bearer authentication is now deprecated**
- While still functional, users are encouraged to migrate to newer authentication methods
- Support for bearer tokens will be removed in a future release

#### FormSite Toolkit
- **Bearer authentication deprecated** in favor of API key authentication
- New integrations should use API key authentication for improved security
- Existing bearer token implementations will continue to work but should be migrated

### Improvements & Fixes

#### Configuration Improvements

**Linear Toolkit** - Base URL is no longer a configurable field. The toolkit now uses a fixed endpoint, simplifying the authentication process.

**Kibana Toolkit** - Removed the default value for Base URL, allowing for more flexible deployment configurations. Users can now specify custom Kibana instances without overriding defaults.

**Gong Toolkit** - Added a sensible default value for Base URL to simplify initial setup. New users can connect without manually configuring the endpoint.

**Insightly Toolkit** - Added default value for the Pod field to streamline configuration. Reduces setup complexity for standard deployments.

**ClickUp Toolkit** - Fixed the Base URL field type for proper validation and handling. Ensures consistent URL formatting across all operations.

#### Dynamic Endpoint Updates

**Brilliant Directories Toolkit** - Implemented dynamic Base URL resolution for the Get Current User Endpoint. Automatically adapts to different deployment environments.

**Braintree Toolkit** - Updated configuration to use production defaults. Implemented dynamic endpoint resolution for better environment handling. Improved reliability for production deployments.

**Auth0 Toolkit** - Replaced hardcoded endpoints with dynamic tenant-based URL resolution. Supports multi-tenant deployments without manual configuration. Automatically constructs the correct endpoint based on the tenant configuration.

#### Endpoint Fixes

**DataScope Toolkit** - Fixed the Get Current User Endpoint to use the correct API path. Resolves authentication verification issues.

**D2L Brightspace Toolkit** - Updated the Get Current User Endpoint to match the latest API specifications. Ensures proper user identification and session validation.

### Migration Guide

For toolkits with breaking changes, please update your configurations as follows:

1. **Make**: Replace Region with the full Base URL (e.g., `https://us-east-1.make.com`)
2. **Bubble**: Replace Subdomain with the full Base URL (e.g., `https://myapp.bubbleapps.io`)

For deprecated authentication methods:
- **HelloBar & FormSite**: Generate new API keys from your account settings and update your authentication configuration

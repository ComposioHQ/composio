## Why do Notion operations show "Composio" instead of the user's name?

Notion attributes actions to the integration itself, not the individual user. The name and logo shown come from the integration configuration. To use a custom name or logo, create your own Notion integration. See [Notion integration docs](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration).

## How do I grant access to more Notion pages?

Open Notion, go to Settings & Members, then Connections. Select the integration (Composio or your custom integration), click "Select pages" or "Manage access", and add or remove pages as needed.

## Does Notion use OAuth scopes?

No. Notion controls access by granting integrations access to specific pages and databases, not through scopes. You don't need to pass scopes when creating an auth config.

## How does Notion's access model work?

It depends on the integration type. OAuth apps (public) let users select which pages to share during authorization. Internal integrations (API key) have page access managed in the integration settings.

## How do I set up custom Google OAuth credentials for Google Sheets?


For a step-by-step guide on creating and configuring your own Google OAuth credentials with Composio, see [How to create OAuth2 credentials for Google Apps](https://composio.dev/auth/googleapps).

## Why am I getting "Quota Exhausted", "rate limit exhausted", or 429?


Google enforces per-minute and daily request quotas. If you're using Composio's default OAuth app, you share that quota with other users, which can cause limits to be hit faster. Use your own OAuth app credentials to get a dedicated quota, and add exponential backoff and retries to handle transient rate limits.

## How do I set up custom Google OAuth credentials for Google Docs?


For a step-by-step guide on creating and configuring your own Google OAuth credentials with Composio, see [How to create OAuth2 credentials for Google Apps](https://composio.dev/auth/googleapps).

## Why am I seeing "App is blocked" when connecting Google Docs?


The OAuth client is requesting scopes that Google hasn't verified for that client. This usually happens when you add extra scopes beyond the defaults.

Remove the additional scopes from your auth config, or create your own OAuth app and submit the scopes for verification. See [How to create OAuth2 credentials for Google Apps](https://composio.dev/auth/googleapps).

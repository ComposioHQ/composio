# Premium Tools

This is a quick overview of premium tools, what they are, how they are priced, what limits they have and such.

## What are premium tools?

Premium tools are essential tool calls that cost us more to run, normally paying for more premium services or longer running tasks.

Think something like `E2B` or `Firecrawl`, these are not really comparable to a `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` call.

These types of tools are separated out so we can price both of them competitively.

This is the current list of premium tools, more will be added over time and this list might change in the future.

- [Code Interpreter (E2B)](/toolkits/codeinterpreter)
- [Firecrawl](/toolkits/firecrawl)
- [Perplexity](/toolkits/perplexityai)
- [Exa](/toolkits/exa)
- [SerpAPI](/toolkits/serpapi)

## How are premium tools priced?

As a rough guide, they are priced at 3x the cost of a standard tool call — the specifics depends on your plan and the tool.

| Plan | Included Standard Tool Calls | Included Premium Tool Calls | Usage Based Standard Tool Calls | Usage Based Premium Tool Calls |
|------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Totally Free | 20k | 1k | – | – |
| Ridiculously Cheap | 250k | 5k | $0.299/1k | $0.897/1k |
| Serious Business | 2M | 50k | $0.249/1k | $0.747/1k |
| Enterprise | Flexible | Flexible | Flexible | Flexible |

This is a quick call out — full pricing details are on the [pricing page](https://composio.dev/pricing).

## What limits do premium tools have?

Premium tools are also subject to lower rate limits than standard tool calls.

| Spending Tier | Standard Tool Calls Rate Limit | Premium Tool Calls Rate Limit |

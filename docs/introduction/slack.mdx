Modify _Composio_ `api-key` by [creating your own](https://app.composio.dev/settings).
<Tip> TestIntegration.*App* uses Composio built-in Integrations </Tip>
<CodeGroup>
```python 
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration
client = Composio("api-key")
#client.get_integration(**YourIntegrationID**)
integration = client.get_integration(TestIntegration.SLACK)
#Trying to initiate a new connection
connected_account = integration.initiate_connection(entity_id = None)
print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connected_account.redirectUrl)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Connected Account Status to be 'Active'">
  If you haven’t, please click on redirectUrl above and complete the flow.
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python 
    #Keep Polling and wait until timeout

```python 
from openai import OpenAI
my_task = "Set a reminder to buy groceries tomorrow at 5pm"
# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Handle Tool Calls - Execute Actions">
<CodeGroup>
```python 
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)
print(execution_details)
print("Completed Task")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>
### Putting it all together
<CodeGroup>
```python 
## Step 1
#!pip install composio-core
## Step 2
from openai import OpenAI
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration
# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
client = Composio("api-key")
#client.get_integration(**YourIntegrationID**)
integration = client.get_integration(TestIntegration.SLACK)
#Trying to initiate a new connection
connected_account = integration.initiate_connection(entity_id = None)
print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connected_account.redirectUrl)
## Step 3
#Keep Polling and wait until timeout
connected_account = connected_account.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
## Step 4
actions = connected_account.get_all_actions()
## Step 5
my_task = "Set a reminder to buy groceries tomorrow at 5pm"
# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)
## Step 6
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)
print(execution_details)
print("Completed Task")
```

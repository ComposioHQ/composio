| Component         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Examples                                                                                                                                           |

| Integrations      | Integrations are tool configurations (eg. Permissions to ask for when connecting an account, ClientID/Secret in the case of OAuth) that will be used to connect your users account to Composio. You can use your own configuration or use Composio's default integrations. | Github Integration that requires repo permission & User data (ex. 1). Linear Integration requiring API Key (2). Linear Integration using Oauth (3) |
| Entity            | Entity is a catch all term for your users who can be individuals, entities, teams, organisations. Composio manages authentication at `Entity` level.                                                                                                                       | Melissa, Sam, ABC Corp, etc                                                                                                                        |
| ConnectedAccounts | Connected accounts represent connections between your app and third-party platforms. They are user-specific instances of integrations, storing credentials and specific configuration details.                                                                             | Melissa's Github account after completing auth with integration, Similarly Sam's Hubspot account.                                                  |
| Tools             | Tools refer to the various applications or tools that can be integrated and used by your agents via Composio.                                                                                                                                                              | Shell manager, Hubspot, Github, Slack & many others                                                                                                |
| Actions           | Actions are tasks that can be performed by your agents. ex. `send email via gmail`                                                                                                                                                                                         | Send email via Gmail, Send email via Outlook, Send email via Sendgrid, etc                                                                         |
| Triggers          | Triggers are predefined conditions that, when met, initiate webhooks to your agents.                                                                                                                                                                                       | New Github Issue, New Github Pull Request, New Github Release, New Hubspot Ticket, New Hubspot Case, etc                                           |


In next few pages, we can go through each component in detail. They will explain how to use each component in the code and what the expected flow should look like.

## Introduction to Entities

- Within Composio, an entity acts as a central hub representing either a user or an organization. 
- This entity consolidates all their connected accounts, providing a unified view of their integrations. 
- For instance, if you have million users connecting various accounts (Github, Hubspot, Slack, etc.) within your application,
each user would be represented as an individual entity. 
- All the accounts linked by a user would then be neatly organized as connected accounts under their respective entity.

## Introduction to Connected Accounts
- When a user connects their account through any of our integrations, a `connected_account` object is created. This object securely stores authentication data such as access tokens and refresh tokens.

### Create or get an entity

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

from composio import ComposioToolSet

toolset = ComposioToolSet(entity_id="default")

entity = toolset.getEntity(id='default')

### Connect an account for an entity
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Via Dashboard">
The Composio dashboard primarily serves as a tool for quickly verifying your integration and trying new connections for initial testing. 
For deploying in a production environment, utilize the SDK or API methods.

### Execute Agent and perform tasks on behalf of an entity

Now, let's get all the actions that can be performed on the entity on GitHub.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
<CodeGroup>
```python Fetch tools
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, Action, App
from openai import OpenAI

openai_client = OpenAI()

# can be configured to use the entity id of the user
tool_set = ComposioToolSet(entity_id="melissa") 

actions = z.get_actions(app_name = App.GITHUB)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Javascript">
<CodeGroup>
```python Execute Agent
actions = tool_set.get_tools(apps=[App.GITHUB])

my_task = "Star a repo composiohq/composio on GitHub"

response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    tools=actions,  # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": my_task},
    ],
)
tool_set.handle_tool_calls(response=response, entity_id="melissa") # entity_id is optional as it has been set in the toolset
```
</CodeGroup>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Now, let's call our agent for this entity to perform the task on Github on behalf of the user.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
<CodeGroup>
```python execute agent
const task = "Star a repo composiohq/composio on GitHub"

const response = await openAI.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    tools: tools,
    messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: task },
    ],
});

await toolset.handle_tool_calls(response, entity.id);
```
</CodeGroup>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Javascript">
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Fetch tools
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({
    apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY,
});

const entity = toolset.client.getEntity('default');
const tools = await toolset.getTools({ apps: ["github"] }, entity.id);
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can use the above pattern to make agents at a user level to perform tasks on their behalf.

When a user connects their account through any of our integrations, a `connected_account` object is created. This object securely stores authentication data such as access tokens and refresh tokens.

## Steps to Connect an Account (~ 4️⃣ 🕰️ minutes )

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Adding Account via Dashboard">
The Composio dashboard primarily serves as a tool for quickly verifying your integration and trying new connections for initial testing. 
For deploying in a production environment, utilize the SDK or API methods.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select the Preferred Integration">
Visit the [Integrations page](https://app.composio.dev/your_apps) and select the integration that best suits your needs.
</Step>
<Step title="Connect Your Account">
To begin the connection process, click the `Add Account` button located in the top right corner of the page.
</Step>
<Step title="Complete Auth Flow">
Complete the authorization process to allow the application to access your account.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Connection Status">
Check the connection status. If the process was successful, the `connected_account` status will display as 'Active'. If not fully completed, it will show as 'Initiated'.
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Add account via SDK">
<Steps>
<Step title="Gather Integration Parameters">
Example: API Key, Subdomain URL, Username.

<CodeGroup>
```python python 
from composio import Composio, App

client = Composio(api_key="COMPOSIO_API_KEY")

entity = client.get_entity(id="default")

# Integration Chosen by User to Connect with

integration = client.get_integration(integration_id)

# list of params req from user

print(integration.get_required_variables())

```
```javascript javascript
import { Composio } from "composio-core";

const client = new Composio();

const entity = await client.getEntity({ id: "default" });

// Get the integration id from the dashboard
const integration = await client.integrations.get({ integrationId: "{{integration_id}}" });

console.log("integration.expectedInputFields", integration.expectedInputFields)
```
</CodeGroup>

Response if `Zendesk` Integration was chosen.
<CodeGroup>
```json Example Response
[
  {
    "name": "subdomain",
    "expected_from_customer": true,
    "displayName": "Zendesk Subdomain",
    "description": "Your Zendesk subdomain (e.g., your-company-name in your-company-name.zendesk.com)",
    "type": "string",
    "required": true
  }
]
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate Connection Request">
Send Requested Params
<CodeGroup>
```python python 
# Collect the subdomain from your user via your platform's frontend
params = {"subdomain":"***zendesk_sub_domain****"}

connection_request = integration.initiate_connection(params=params, entity_id = "")

if connection_request.redirectUrl != "":
print("Please complete the auth flow by opening this link: ", connection_request.redirectUrl)
else:
print("The account status is: ",connection_request)
```
```javascript javascript
const entity = await client.getEntity({ id: "default" });

const params = {
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
const connection = await entity.initiateConnection('serpapi',null, params);

```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Authorisation Flow Redirect (Optional)">

In case of **OAuth Flow**, _redirectUrl_ will be returned.

<Tip>
Redirect User for OAuth Authorisation Completion page.
</Tip>

On approval, User will be redirected back to configured URL.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Example Connection Request
{
    "connectionStatus": "INITIATED",
    "connectedAccountId": "1f32dbf-f7cfec95e567",
    "redirectUrl": "https://ghghghh.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new?client_id=test_aa&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbackend.composio.dev%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fauth"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Validate Connection Request">

Check if the status has been updated.

<AccordionGroup title="Get Status of Connection Request">
<Accordion title="Fetch ConnectedAccount">
Get Connected Account using ID & Verify value of status
<CodeGroup>
```python Get Connected Account Object
connected_account = composio.get_connected_account(connection_request.id)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Poll using `Wait` Method">
<CodeGroup>
```python Polling until Expiry
connected_account = connection_request.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
Print Status 
<CodeGroup>
```python Print ConnectedAccount Status
print(connected_account.status)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using Connected Accounts

By leveraging the `connected_account.id`, you can execute actions or configure triggers. For example, if you need to create a repository on GitHub, you can use the Composio SDK or the Action API. Simply provide the `connection_id` to enable this operation.

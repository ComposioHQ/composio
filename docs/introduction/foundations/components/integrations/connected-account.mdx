## Steps to Connect an Account (~ 4️⃣ 🕰️ minutes )

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Via Dashboard">
The Composio dashboard primarily serves as a tool for quickly verifying your integration and trying new connections for initial testing. 
For deploying in a production environment, utilize the SDK or API methods.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Preferred Integration">
    Visit the [Integrations page](https://app.composio.dev/your_apps) and select the integration that best suits your needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Your Account">
    To begin the connection process, click the `Add Account` button located in the top right corner of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Auth Flow">
    Complete the authorization process to allow the application to access your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connection Status">
    Check the connection status. If the process was successful, the `connected_account` status will display as 'Active'. If not fully completed, it will show as 'Initiated'.
  </Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>


<Tab title="Python">
<Steps>
<Step title="Fetch Integration Parameters">
  Example: API Key, Subdomain URL, Username.
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python python 
    from composio import ComposioToolSet,App

    client = Composio(api_key="COMPOSIO_API_KEY")

    entity = client.get_entity(id="default")

    # Integration Chosen by User to Connect with

    integration = client.get_integration(integration_id)

    # list of params req from user

    print(integration.get_required_variables())
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

Response if `Zendesk` Integration was chosen.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```json Example Response
    [
      {
        "name": "subdomain",
        "expected_from_customer": true,
        "displayName": "Zendesk Subdomain",
        "description": "Your Zendesk subdomain (e.g., your-company-name in your-company-name.zendesk.com)",
        "type": "string",
        "required": true
      }
    ]
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate Connection Request">
Send Requested Params
<CodeGroup>
```python 
# Collect the subdomain from your user via your platform's frontend
auth_config = {"subdomain":"***zendesk_sub_domain****"}

connection_request = integration.initiate_connection(params=auth_config, entity_id = "")

if connection_request.redirectUrl != "":
print("Please complete the auth flow by opening this link: ", connection_request.redirectUrl)
else:
print("The account status is: ",connection_request)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Authorisation Flow Redirect (Optional)">

## What are local tools?
Composio provides you with hundreds of tools and thousands of prebuilt actions, which contains both: 
 1. Managed and run at Composio's end,
 2. Running and executed locally at the user's machine. 

The second kind is termed as **Local Tools** and some of its advantages are: 

* The execution data does not need to leave user's machine,
* User can add as many new Tools and Actions by themselves, and once added,  can use with any of Composio's supported platforms.

We have already added a number of useful local tools and are continuously adding more. 
Here's the link to use all of them out.


## Adding a Custom Local tool in Python

In addition to the existing tools, a user can easily create their own tool and use with any of the supported frameworks of composio.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add the action Decorator">

In your code, add ```@action(toolname=[TOOL_NAME], requires=["LIBRARIES"])``` decorater to the function that returns the response to the LLM.

Specify the tool name as the decorater's parameter
<CodeGroup>
```python Create a Custom Action using Decorator
from composio import action

@action(toolname="cow", requires=["cowsay"])
def say(message: str) -> str:
    """
    Cow will say whatever you want it to say.

    :param message: Message string
    :return greeting: Formatted message.
    """
    import cowsay

    return cowsay.get_output_string("cow", message)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Import your Action">

Now that your Custom Action is ready, Import it in your main file and start using it with your LLM.
Integrate this with any agentic framework you want!
<CodeGroup>
```python Use the custom tool
from composio import action
from custom_tools import say

composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()

# Get required tools
tools = [
    *composio_toolset.get_actions(
        actions=[
            say,  # This is the saved custom tool
        ]
    ),
]
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

**Examples/Sample Code:**

There are lot of local tools available in `composio/tools/local` directory, that you can use as a reference. To get started, you should check out the below two tools:

- [Mathematical tool](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/master/python/composio/tools/local/mathematical/tool.py): Simple tool to perform mathematical operations.
- [Greptile tool](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/master/python/composio/tools/local/greptile/tool.py): Tool to integrate with [Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/) framework.

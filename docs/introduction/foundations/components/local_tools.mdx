Composio provides you with hundreds of tools and thousands of prebuilt actions, which contains both: 
 1. Managed and run at Composio's end,
 2. Running and executed locally at the user's machine. 

The second kind is termed as **Local Tools** and some of its advantages are: 

* The execution data does not need to leave user's machine,
* User can add as many new Tools and Actions by themselves, and once added,  can use with any of Composio's supported platforms.

We have already added a number of local tools and are continuously adding more.

## Adding a Custom Local tool

In addition to the existing tools, a user can easily create their own tool and use with any of the supported frameworks of composio.

**Pre-requisites:**

* [Clone the Composio repo](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio)
* [Setting up the development environment](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup)


Your local tool and its actions should be organized as follows:
<CodeGroup>
```bash File Structure of a local tool and its Actions files.
composio/
└── tools/
   └── local/
       └── <tool_name>/
           ├── __init__.py
           ├── tool.py
           └── actions/
               ├── __init__.py
               └── <action_name>.py 
```
</CodeGroup>

**Files and their Contents:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the Tool Class">
**`composio/tools/local/<tool_name>/tool.py`**

<CodeGroup>
   ```python Defines the tool class
    import typing as t
    from composio.tools.local.base import Action, Tool
    from .actions.<action_name> import <ActionName>  # Import your action class

    class <ToolName>(Tool):
        """
        Description of your tool.
        """

        def actions(self) -> list[t.Type[Action]]:
            return [<ActionName>]

        def triggers(self) -> list:
            return []  # If applicable, define triggers here
   ```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Export the Tool Class">
**`composio/tools/local/<tool_name>/__init__.py`:**
<CodeGroup>
   ```python Exports the tool class
   from .tool import <ToolName>
   ```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Define an Action for Your Tool">
**`composio/tools/local/<tool_name>/actions/<action_name>.py`** 

<CodeGroup>
   ```python Defines an action for your tool
   from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
   from composio.tools.local.base import Action

   class <RequestSchema>(BaseModel):
       # Define input schema for your action
       # Example:
       # text: str = Field(..., description="Input text for the action")

   class <ResponseSchema>(BaseModel):
       # Define output schema for your action
       # Example:
       # result: str = Field(..., description="Result of the action")

   class <ActionName>(Action[<RequestSchema>, <ResponseSchema>]):
       """
       Description of your action.
       """

       display_name = "Friendly name of your action"
       _request_schema = <RequestSchema>
       _response_schema = <ResponseSchema>
       _tags = ["tag1", "tag2"]  # Optional tags to categorize your action
       _tool_name = "<tool_name>"  # Tool name, same as directory name

       def execute(
           self, request_data: <RequestSchema>, authorisation_data: dict = {}
       ) -> <ResponseSchema>:
           # Implement logic to process input and return output
           # Example:
           # response_data = {"result": "Processed text: " + request_data.text}
           return {"execution_details": {"executed": True}, "response_data": response_data}
   ```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>


<Step title="Export the Action Class">
**`composio/tools/local/<tool_name>/actions/__init__.py`:** 

<CodeGroup>
   ```python Exports the action class
   from .<action_name> import <ActionName>
   ```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>


<Step title="Add your tool in local tools">
**`composio/tools/local/__init__.py`:** 

<CodeGroup>
   ```python Add your tool
    from pathlib import Path
    from composio.tools.local.filetool import FileTool
    from composio.tools.local.greptile import Greptile
    from composio.tools.local.<tool_name> import <ToolName> # Import your tool class

    TOOLS_PATH = Path(__file__).parent
    TOOLS = [
        FileTool,
        Greptile,
        <ToolName>, # Add your tool here
    ]
   ```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>


<Step title="Add New App and Action Enum value">
Run the below command to add a new tool and action to the enum values.

```bash
composio apps update
```

If this command fails or you still don't see your tool and action in the enum values, then update the enum values manually via below steps:
**`composio/client/enums.py`:** 

<CodeGroup>
```python Add new App & Action entry

class App(str, Enum):
    """Composio App."""

    ABLY = "ably"
    ACCELO = "accelo"
    <TOOL_ENUM_NAME> = <_tool_name_>



class Action(tuple, Enum):
    """App action."""

    MATHEMATICAL_CALCULATOR = ("mathematical", "mathematical_calculator", True, True)
    LOCALWORKSPACE_WORKSPACESTATUSACTION = ("localworkspace", "localworkspace_workspacestatusaction", True, True)
    LOCALWORKSPACE_CREATEWORKSPACEACTION = ("localworkspace", "localworkspace_createworkspaceaction", True, True)
    <ACTION_ENUM_NAME> = ( <_tool_name>, <_action_name>, True, True)

```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>


<Info> Make sure `_tool_name` is always the lowercase of the `<ToolName>` class we defined in the previous steps. E.g if we defined `<ToolName>` as `MyTool`, then _tool_name should be `mytool`.</Info>

<Info> Make sure `TOOL_ENUM_NAME` and `ACTION_ENUM_NAME` is always one or more uppercase words seperated by _.</Info>

**Examples/Sample Code:**

There are lot of local tools available in `composio/tools/local` directory, that you can use as a reference. To get started, you should check out the below two tools:

- [Mathematical tool](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/master/python/composio/tools/local/mathematical/tool.py): Simple tool to perform mathematical operations.
- [Greptile tool](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/master/python/composio/tools/local/greptile/tool.py): Tool to integrate with [Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/) framework.

**Key Points:**

* Replace placeholders `<tool_name>`, `<action_name>`, `<ToolName>`, `<ActionName>`, `<RequestSchema>`, `<ResponseSchema>` with your own names and logic.
* Use the Composio documentation for further details on defining tools and actions: [https://docs.composio.dev/](https://docs.composio.dev/)
* Install any required dependencies for your tools and actions.

### Welcome to Composio

![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

Composio enables agents to execute tasks which require interaction of agent with world outside via APIs, RPCs, Shells, Filemanagers, Browser or 🌐.

For instance, to **accomplish** a task like **"Create a new repository on GitHub"**,
your **agent needs to integrate with GitHub's API**.
It involves translating API specifications into functions callable schema,
managing authentication for multiple users and many other things which Composio does out of box.

Agents can now **execute code, interact with your local system, receive triggers or execute action for [150+ external tools](/apps).**

We support a wide range of well-known authentication protocols, including `OAuth1.0/OAuth2.0`, `ApiKey`, and `Basic`, among others.

### Observability for Agent Actions

We offer comprehensive observability and logging for every interaction your agents have with tools,
enabling you to monitor and trace all actions performed by agents in real time.

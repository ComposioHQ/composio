When deploying your application to production, it is crucial to configure your Composio API key correctly to ensure smooth operation. Follow these steps to use the Composio SDK in production:

### Step 1: Set Your Composio API Key
Ensure that your COMPOSIO_API_KEY is set as an environment variable in your production environment. This can be done through the platform's UI or via your deployment scripts.

### Step 2: Initialize the Composio Client
In your application code, initialize the Composio client using the environment variable for the API key. Here is an example in Python:

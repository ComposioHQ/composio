### Introduction to Entities

In Composio, an entity encapsulates all associated accounts for either a user or an organization. This consolidation simplifies the administration of multiple accounts, allowing you to manage them seamlessly. An entity can be identified using any unique identifier, such as an email address.

### Creating and Managing Entities

To create or retrieve an entity for a user, you can use their unique identifier. Here’s an example in Python:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
<CodeGroup>
```python Python Code Snippet to get an entity (user)
from composio import Composio

composio_client = Composio(api_key="COMPOSIO_API_KEY")
entity = composio_client.get_entity(id='user_email_id')
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
<Tab title="JS">
<CodeGroup>
```javascript JS Code Snippet to get an entity (user)
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const openai_client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAIKEY
});
const entity = toolset.client.getEntity(id='user_email_id');
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Once you have the entity, you can manage the connected accounts. If an account is not connected, you can prompt the user to connect their account.

### Getting Connected Accounts

To get the connected accounts for an entity, you can use the following code:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
<CodeGroup>
```python Python Code Snippet to get a connected account
try:
    connected_account  = entity.get_connection(app="slack")
except Exception as e:
    print("No connected account found")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
<Tab title="JS">
<CodeGroup>
```javascript JS Code Snippet to get a connected account
const connected_account  = await entity.getConnection("slack");
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This code attempts to retrieve the connected account for Slack. If no connected account is found, it catches the exception and prints a message.

### Performing Actions on Behalf of Users

Composio allows you to perform actions on behalf of users. For example, you can fetch all available actions that can be performed on GitHub:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
<CodeGroup>
```python python
actions = entity.get_tools(app_name=App.GITHUB)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
<Tab title="JS">
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript
const actions = entity.getActions(app_name=App.GITHUB);
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

With the actions fetched, you can configure an agent to perform tasks on GitHub on behalf of the user. Here’s an example:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
<CodeGroup>
```python python

from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, App
from openai import OpenAI

openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
tool_set = ComposioToolSet(entity_id="melissa")
actions = tool_set.get_tools(apps=[App.GITHUB])

my_task = "Star a repo composiohq/composio on GitHub"

response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    tools=actions,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": my_task},
    ],
)
tool_set.handle_tool_calls(response=response, entity_id="melissa")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
<Tab title="JS">
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const openai_client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({
    apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY,
});

const tools = await toolset.getActions({actions: ['github_star_repo']})

const task = "Star a repo composiohq/composio on GitHub"

const response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    tools: tools,
    messages: [
        {role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {role: "user", content: task},
    ],
});

await toolset.handleToolCall(response, "melissa");
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

In this example, an agent is configured to star a repository on GitHub on behalf of the user. The OpenAI API is used to process the request and perform the action.

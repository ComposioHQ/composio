### Entities

- Each **user** is represented by a **unique entity ID**.
- If you have two users, **Jessica** and **Melissa**, they will each have **unique entity IDs**.
<Info>If not specified, `default` will be used as the entity ID.</Info>

You can use an entity object to manage connected accounts and perform actions on behalf of a user (more on this [here](/patterns/tools/use-tools/action-guide-without-agents#how-can-i-use-tools-for-a-specific-user)). Here's how to retrieve an entity object:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import ComposioToolSet

toolset = ComposioToolSet()
entity = toolset.get_entity(id='Jessica')
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet();
const entity = toolset.client.getEntity(id='Jessica');
```
</CodeGroup>

### Connected Accounts
- When a user connects their account, a `connected_account` object is created. 
- **Connected Account** securely stores **authentication data** such as **API keys, access tokens and refresh tokens**.

### How to initiate a new connection for your user
Follow these steps to initiate a new connection for your user (for both OAuth and non-OAuth based Apps):

<Tabs>
<Tab title="OAuth-Based Apps">
Initiate a new connection by passing the redirect url, entity id & app.
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import ComposioToolSet, App 
toolset = ComposioToolSet()

# URL that the user will be redirected to after completing the authentication process
redirect_url = "https://yourwebsite.com/connection/success"

# Unique identifier for the user for whom the connection is being created
entity_id = "Jessica" 

# Initiate new connection (You can use integration_id instead of app)
connection_request = toolset.initiate_connection(redirect_url=redirect_url, entity_id=entity_id, app=App.GMAIL)

# Redirect the user to the URL below
print(connection_request.redirectUrl)

# Check the status of the connection (it can be initiated, active, or failed)
print(connection_request.connectionStatus)
```

```javascript Javascript
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";
const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet();

// URL that the user will be redirected to after completing the authentication process
const redirectURL = "https://yourwebsite.com/connection/success"

// Unique identifier for the user for whom the connection is being created
const entityId = "Jessica" 

// Initiate new connection (You can use integration_id instead of app)
const connectionRequest = await toolset.client.connectedAccounts.initiate({
  app: "gmail",
  redirect_url: redirectURL,
  entityId: entityId,
});

// Redirect the user to the URL below
console.log(connectionRequest.redirectUrl);

// Check the status of the connection (it can be initiated, active, or failed)
console.log(connectionRequest.connectionStatus);
```
</CodeGroup>
<Tip>Each App integration has a unique **integration ID**. You can use this ID instead of the **app name** when creating connections.</Tip>

Get the expected parameters required to create a connection & pass then while initiating a new connection (API Key, Subdomain URL, Username etc.).
<Steps>
<Step title="Collect parameters required to create a connection">
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import ComposioToolSet, App
toolset = ComposioToolSet()

# You can use integration_id instead of app
response = toolset.get_expected_params_for_user(app=App.FIRECRAWL) 

print(response["expected_params"])
```

```javascript Javascript
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";
const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet();

// You can use integration_id instead of app
const expectedInputFields = await toolset.getExpectedParamsForUser({
    app: "firecrawl",
});

console.log(expectedInputFields)
```
</CodeGroup>

}

# Initiate new connection (You can use integration_id instead of app)

```javascript Javascript
// Unique identifier for the user for whom the connection is being created
const entityId = "Jessica" 

// Add the parameters collected from the user
const collectedParams = {
    "api_key": "<your_api_key>"

    data: {
        ...collectedParams
    },
    entityId: entityId,

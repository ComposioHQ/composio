## Introduction to Entities

In Composio, an entity represents either a user or an organization, encapsulating all associated accounts under a single management umbrella. 
This consolidation simplifies the administration of multiple accounts.


## Make your user do a task on Github


### Default Imports
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";


const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({
    apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY,
});

const openai_client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAIKEY
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Let's create an entity for a user via their email. Email is just an example, you can use any unique identifier for the entity.
### Create or get an entity
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript
const entity = await toolset.client.getEntity(id='user_email_id');
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's get the connected account for the entity. If the connected account does not exist, let's get the user to connect their account.
### Get Connected accounts 
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript
const connected_account  = await entity.getConnection("slack");
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's get all the actions that can be performed on the entity on GitHub. You can avoid filtering via Github if you want to see all the actions.
### Get all actions
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript
const actions = entity.get_action({actions: ['github_issues_create']})
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's call our agent for this entity to perform the task on Github on behalf of the user.
### Agent Execution
<CodeGroup>
```javascript javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({
    apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY,
});

const tools = await toolset.get_actions({actions: ['github_star_repo']})

const task = "Star a repo ComposioHQ/composio on GitHub"

const response = await toolset.client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    tools: tools,
    messages: [
        {role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {role: "user", content: task},
    ],
});

await toolset.handle_tool_call(response, entity.id="melissa");
```
</CodeGroup>

You can use the above pattern to make agents at a user level to perform tasks on their behalf.

<Warning>
Store your API key securely. It's used to authenticate your requests to the Composio API.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

### With the CLI

<Note>
When using the Composio CLI, you don't need to manually set the API key. The CLI manages authentication automatically.
</Note>

### In Your Environment

To use your API key in scripts or applications, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export COMPOSIO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Alternatively, you can pass it directly when invoking Composio tools or clients.

## Setup

If you haven’t setup a project before, check out the
[setup guide](/getting-started/setup) before starting.

## Pipelines

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines`</sub>

This page will show all the pipelines in your project.

> Core abstraction: [Pipeline](/design/core-abstractions#pipeline)
>
> A pipeline contains references to all the blocks of code you want to run,
> charts for visualizing data, and organizes the dependency between each block
> of code.

![Pipelines](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/pipelines-index.jpg?raw=true)

Learn more about
[**projects and pipelines here**](/design/core-abstractions#project).

From this page, you can also create a new pipeline by clicking the

**`[+ New pipeline]`** button.

#### Creating new pipeline

Creating a new pipeline will take you to the **Pipeline edit page**; a
notebook-like experience for adding blocks, creating dependencies between
blocks, testing code, and visualizing data with charts.

</sub>

View all the runs for every pipeline in your current project.

## Pipeline detail

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/[uuid]`</sub>

This page contains all the information and history for a single pipeline:

1. [Triggers](/design/core-abstractions#trigger)
1. [Runs](/design/core-abstractions#run)
1. [Logs](/design/core-abstractions#log)

## Triggers

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/triggers`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/triggers)
</sub>

This page shows all the active and inactive triggers for a single pipeline.

> Core abstraction: [Trigger](/design/core-abstractions#trigger)
>
> A trigger is a set of instructions that determine when or how a pipeline
> should run.

![Pipeline detail](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/pipeline-detail.jpg?raw=true)

---

#### Create trigger

<sub>`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/[uuid]/triggers/[id]/edit`</sub>

Create a new trigger for this pipeline by clicking the **`[+ Create]`** button
near the top of the page.

You can configure the trigger to run the pipeline on a schedule, when an event
occurs, or when an API is called.

> Core abstraction: [Schedule](/design/core-abstractions#schedule)
>
> A schedule type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run after a start date
> and on a set interval.

---

> Core abstraction: [Event](/design/core-abstractions#event)
>
> An event type trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific
> event occurs.

---

> Core abstraction: [API](/design/core-abstractions#api)
>
> An API trigger will instruct the pipeline to run whenever a specific API
> is called.

![Trigger create](https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/pipelines/trigger-create.jpg?raw=true)

<sub>

---

#### Trigger detail

On this page, you can start or pause the trigger. Starting the trigger will make
it active. Pausing the trigger will prevent it from running the pipeline.

<Note>
  If you have other triggers for this pipeline, pausing 1 trigger may not stop
  the pipeline from running since other triggers can also run the pipeline.
</Note>

You can also edit the trigger after creating it by clicking the

**`[Edit trigger]`** button.

## Logs

<sub>
  [`http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/logs`](http://localhost:3000/pipelines/example_pipeline/logs)
</sub>

Browse all logs for a pipeline. You can search and filter logs by log level,
block type, block UUID, and more.

> Core abstraction: [**Log**](/design/core-abstractions#log)
>
> A log is a file that contains system output information.

## Monitor

You can monitor many metrics for each of your pipelines and blocks. Soon, you’ll
be able to monitor aggregate metrics across all pipelines and blocks.

## Concurrency

You can limit the concurrency of the block execution to reduce resource consumption.

### Global concurrency
You can configure the maximum number of concurrent block runs in project’s metadata.yaml via queue_config.

```yaml
queue_config:
  concurrency: 100
```
The default value of concurrency is 20.

### Pipeline level concurrency
You can edit the `concurrency_config` in each pipeline's metadata.yaml file to enforce pipeline level concurrency.
Here is the example:
```yaml
concurrency_config:
  block_run_limit: 5
  pipeline_run_limit: 3
```
* `block_run_limit`: limit the concurrent blocks runs in one pipeline run.
* `pipeline_run_limit`: limit the concurrent pipeline runs in one pipeline trigger.
* `pipeline_run_limit_all_triggers`: limit the concurrent pipeline runs across all trigers in a pipeline.
* `on_pipeline_run_limit_reached`: choose whether to `wait` or `skip` when the pipeline run limit is reached.

## Variable storage
Mage automatically persists the output of block runs on disk. You can specify the path or the storage for block output variables
in the following ways.
* Specify the data directory path via `MAGE_DATA_DIR` environment variable. If you use Mage docker image, this environment
  variable is set to `/home/src/mage_data` by default.
* If the `MAGE_DATA_DIR` environment variable is not set, you can set the `variables_dir` path in project's metadata.yaml. Here is
  an example:
  ```yaml
  variables_dir: /home/src/mage_data
  ```
* You can also use an external storage to store the block output variables by specifying the `remote_variables_dir` path in project's
  metadata.yaml.
  * AWS S3 storage:
    ```yaml
    variables_dir: /home/src/mage_data
    remote_variables_dir: s3://bucket/path_prefix
    ```
  * Google Cloud Storage:
    ```yaml
    variables_dir: /home/src/mage_data
    remote_variables_dir: gs://bucket/path_prefix
    ```
    When using GCS for your remote variables directory, if you run into a "Your default credentials were not found"
    error, you may need to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your
    `application_default_credentials.json` file with your Google Cloud credentials and the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`
    environment variable to your Google Cloud project ID.

## Variable retention
If you want to clean up the old variables in your variable storage, you can set the `variables_retention_period`
config in project's metadata.yaml. The valid period should end with "d", "h", or "w".

Example config:
```yaml
variables_retention_period: 30d
```

After configuring `variables_retention_period` in project's metadata.yaml, you can run the following command
to clean up old variables:
```bash
mage clean-cached-variables [project_path]
```

## Cache block output in memory

By default, Mage persists block output on disk. In pipeline's metadata.yaml, you have the option to configure the pipeline to cache
the block output in memory instead of persisting the block output on disk. The feature is only supported in standard batch
pipeline (without dynamic blocks) for now.

Example config:
```yaml
cache_block_output_in_memory: true
run_pipeline_in_one_process: true
```

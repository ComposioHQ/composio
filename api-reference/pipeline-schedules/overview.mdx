      If `true`, then blocks in the pipeline will continue to run even if unrelated blocks fail.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="create_initial_pipeline_run" type="boolean">
      If `true`, then an initial pipeline run will be created immediately after enabling the
      trigger if the trigger's current execution date is after its start date time but before
      current time.

      For example, if the current time is `1/4/24 12:00 UTC` and you create a daily trigger, the
      current execution date would be `2024-01-04 00:00`. If the start date was set to
      `1/3/24 12:00 UTC`, which is before the current execution date, and the `create_initial_pipeline_run`
      setting was enabled, a pipeline run with execution date `2024-01-04 00:00` would get created
      immediately.

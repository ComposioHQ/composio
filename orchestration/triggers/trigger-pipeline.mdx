## How to trigger a pipeline

There are 2 ways you can trigger a pipeline from code:

### Block template

Add a [data loader](/development/blocks/data_loaders/templates#trigger-pipeline)
or [data exporter](/development/blocks/data_exporters/templates#trigger-pipeline)
block template named `Orchestration → Trigger pipeline`.

### Custom code

Add a block and use the following code example within the block’s function:

```python
from mage_ai.orchestration.triggers.api import trigger_pipeline


trigger_pipeline(
    'pipeline_uuid',
    variables={},
    check_status=False,
    error_on_failure=False,
    poll_interval=60,
    poll_timeout=None,
    schedule_name=None,  # Enter a unique name to create a new trigger each time
    verbose=True,
)
```

## Parameters

| `variables` | Runtime variables for the pipeline. | `{}` | `{ 'env': 'dev' }` | |
| `check_status` | Poll and check the status of the triggered pipeline. | `False` | `False` or `True` | |
| `error_on_failure` | Raise an exception if the triggered pipeline fails. | `False` | `False` or `True` | |
| `poll_interval` | Check the status of triggered pipeline every N seconds. | `60` | `300` | |
| `poll_timeout` | After N seconds have elapsed, raise an exception if the triggered pipeline hasn’t finished running successful. | `None` | `3600` | |

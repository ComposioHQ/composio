A backfill creates 1 or more pipeline runs for a pipeline. There are 2 types of backfills:

1. Date and time window
1. Custom code

## Date and time window

Create 1 or more pipeline runs between 2 datetime values.

The datetime of each instance is used as the `execution_date` for the pipeline run.

For example, if the backfill has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Value|
| --- | --- |
| Start datetime | `2023-01-01T03:00:00` |
| End datetime | `2023-01-05T03:00:00` |
| Interval type | `day` |
| Interval units | `2` |

Then the following pipeline runs will be created:

| `id` | `execution_date` | `ds` | `hr` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `2023-01-01T03:00:00` | `2023-01-01` | `03` |
| 2 | `2023-01-03T03:00:00` | `2023-01-03` | `03` |

---

## Custom code

The output of a backfill code will be used to generate the pipeline runs.

For example, if the backfill code has the following content:

```python
backfill_data = []

for index, _ in range(3):
    backfill_data.append(dict(
        partition=index,
        power=5,
    ))

backfill_data
```

Then the following pipeline runs will be created:


| `id` | `execution_date` | `ds` | `hr` | `partition` | `power` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `2023-01-01T00:00:00` | `2023-01-01` | `00` | `0` | `5` |
| 2 | `2023-01-01T00:00:00` | `2023-01-01` | `00` | `1` | `5` |
| 3 | `2023-01-01T00:00:00` | `2023-01-01` | `00` | `2` | `5` |

## Extra runtime variables from pipeline run

If your pipeline run belongs to a trigger that is scheduled, then the following extra
variables are available in your Python block’s keyword arguments (e.g. `kwargs`).

| Key | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interval_start_datetime` | The `datetime` when the pipeline run is scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 23, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |
| `interval_end_datetime` | The `datetime` when the next pipeline run is scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |
| `interval_seconds` | The number of seconds between the current pipeline run and the next pipeline run. | `86400` |
| `interval_start_datetime_previous` | The `datetime` when the previous pipeline run was scheduled for. | `datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 22, 7, 0, 0, 0)` |

### SQL block

If you’re using a SQL block, here is an example of how you can access these variables:

```sql
SELECT
    '{{ interval_start_datetime }}' AS interval_start_datetime
    , '{{ interval_end_datetime }}' AS interval_end_datetime
    , '{{ interval_seconds }}' AS interval_seconds
    , '{{ interval_start_datetime_previous }}' AS interval_start_datetime_previous
```

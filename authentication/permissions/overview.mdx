## How to use

### Turn on and require user permissions

<Note>
    You must have [User authentication](/production/authentication/overview) enabled.
</Note>

Set the environment variable named `REQUIRE_USER_PERMISSIONS` to the value `1`.

You may need to restart your Mage application for the environment variable to be updated and
for the application to enable user permissions.

### Create roles

<Note>
    You must be the owner or have a role that grants permissions to read and write on the following
    entities:

    - `Permission`
    - `Role`
    - `RolePermission`
    - `UserRole`
    - `User`
</Note>

1. Go the the Mage project settings and click on the navigation row labeled <b>Roles</b>.
1. On the roles list page, there is a button labeled <b>Create default roles and permissions</b>.
    If you click this button, 6 roles and a few hundred permissions will be created.

    The roles are:

    - Admin default permissions
    - Editor default permissions
    - Editor with notebook edit access
    - Editor with pipeline edit access
    - Owner default permissions
    - Viewer default permissions

    Each role will have a set of permissions that match the Mage API policies that are normally
    used to authenticate operations when the user authentication feature is turned on but
    the user permissions feature is turned off.
1. Alternatively, click the button <b>Add new role</b> to create a single new role.
1. Enter in a unique name for the role.
1. Click the button <b>Create new role</b> to save the role.
1. Once you create the role, you’ll be taken to the role detail page.
1. From here, you can add existing permissions to the role.
1. From here, you can add existing users to the role. This will grant permissions or
    deny operations for user.

### Create permissions

1. Go the the Mage project settings and click on the navigation row labeled <b>Permissions</b>.
1. Click the button <b>Add new permission</b> to create a new permission.
1. Select an entity that these permissions will be applied to.
    An entity refers to a defined API endpoint that currently exists in the Mage application.

    For example, the entity `Pipeline` applies to the API endpoints `/pipelines`.
1. Optionally enter an entity UUID that these permissions are applied to.
    For example, you can grant or deny permissions to a specific pipeline by selecting the entity
    `Pipeline` and entering the entity `UUID` `example_pipeline`.
    This permission will only be applied to the pipeline with the UUID `example_pipeline`.
1. Under the section labeled <b>Access</b>, toggle 1 or more accesses to grant.
    For more information on what each access grants or denies,
    read the [permissions documentation](/authentication/permissions/permissions).
1. Click the button <b>Create new permission</b> to save the permission.
1. Once you create the role, you’ll be taken to the role detail page.
1. From here, you can edit the permission.
1. From here, you can add this permission to existing roles.

1. Click on a row for an existing user.
1. From here, you can assign existing roles to the user.
1. Alternatively, you can add a user to a role by following these steps:
    1. Go to the [roles list page](http://localhost:6789/settings/workspace/roles).
    1. Click on a row for an existing role.

## Basic Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks.

```
helloWorld();
```

````md
```
helloWorld();
```
````

## Syntax Highlighting

Put the name of your programming language after the three backticks to get syntax highlighting.

We use [Prism](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) for syntax highlighting. [Test Drive Prism](https://prismjs.com/test.html#language=markup) lists all the languages supported.

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

## Names

You can add more text after the programming language to set the name of your code example. The text can be anything as long as its all in one line.

```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = 'world';
```

````md Code Block Example
```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = 'world';
```
````

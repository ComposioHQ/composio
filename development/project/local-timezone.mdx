You can display dates on various pages (e.g. the Pipelines list and
Triggers/Pipeline runs/Block runs pages) in your local timezone, as
well as configure the start date for triggers and backfills in local
time.

## Steps to enable local timezone setting

1. Go to your project's `Settings` page (with the wrench icon) from the
left vertical navigation panel.
2. Under the "Features" section, click the toggle to turn the `Display local timezone`
setting on.
3. Then click the blue `Save project settings` button to save and persist the
new settings. If you do not click this button, you will lose any changes when
leaving the page.

- Alternatively (starting with v0.9.48), you can simply click on the time in the header
and toggle on the `Display local timezone` setting from the dropdown menu. This may
require a page refresh for the timestamps to change to UTC or local time.

<Info>
  Please note that certain pages (e.g. a pipeline's Monitor page) or components
  (e.g. Pipeline run bar charts) may still be in UTC time. These UTC dates may
  only display the date (e.g. 2023-09-01) without any time. Dates in local time
  will have a timezone offset (e.g. -07:00) in the timestamp (e.g.
  2023-09-01T12:30:45-07:00).

## Metrics

Here are the following metrics that are monitored for each pipeline and block:

- Pipeline runs completed successfully
- Pipeline runs failed
- Block runs completed successfully
- Block runs failed
- How long each block ran for
- _CPU usage for each block run (coming soon)_
- _Memory usage for each block run (coming soon)_
- _Data validation success for each block (coming soon)_
- _Data validation failure for each block (coming soon)_

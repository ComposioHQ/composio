## Python3 kernel <a name="python3"></a>

Python3 is the default kernel. You can prototype and transform small to medium
size datasets with this kernel. Pipelines built with this kernel can be executed
in Python environments.

## PySpark kernel <a name="pyspark"></a>

We support running PySpark kernel to prototype with large datasets and build
pipelines to transform large datasets.

Instructions for running PySpark kernel

- Launch editor with docker:
  `docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start [project_name]`
- Specify PySpark kernel related [metadata](#metadata) in project's
  metadata.yaml file
- Launch a remote AWS EMR Spark cluster. Install mage_ai library in bootstrap
  actions. Make sure the EMR cluster is publicly accessible.
  - You can use the `create_emr.py` script under
    [scripts/spark](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/tree/master/scripts/spark)
    folder to launch a new EMR cluster. Example:
    `python3 create_cluster.py [project_path]`. Please make sure your AWS
    crendentials are provided in `~/.aws/credentials` file or environment
    variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) when executing
    the script.
- Connect to the remote spark cluster with command
  `ssh -i [path_to_key_pair] -L 0.0.0.0:9999:localhost:8998 [master_ec2_public_dns_name]`
  - `path_to_key_pair` is the path to the `ec2_key_pair_name` configured in
    `metadata.yaml` file
  - Find the `master_ec2_public_dns_name` in your newly created EMR cluster page
    under attribute `Master public DNS`

Once you finish using the PySpark kernel, please remember to terminate the
cluster in AWS console to avoid unnecessary costs.

### Metadata

When using PySpark kernel, we need to specify a s3 path as the variables dir,
which will be used to store the output of each block. We also need to provide
EMR cluster related config fields for cluster creation. The config fields can be
configured in project's metadata.yaml file. Example:

```yaml
remote_variables_dir: s3://bucket/path

emr_config:
  master_security_group: "sg-xxxxxxxxxxxx" # Optional. Use EMR-managed security group by default.
  slave_security_group: "sg-yyyyyyyyyyyy" # Optional. Use EMR-managed security group by default.
  master_instance_type: "r5.4xlarge" # Optional. Default value: r5.4xlarge
  slave_instance_type: "r5.4xlarge" # Optional. Default value: r5.4xlarge
  # ec2_key_name must be configured during cluster launch to enable SSH access.
  # You can create a key pair in page https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2#KeyPairs and download the key file.
  ec2_key_name: "[ec2_key_pair_name]"
```

### Pipeline execution

Pipelines built with this kernel can be executed in PySpark environments.

We support executing PySpark pipelines in EMR cluster automatically. You'll need
to specify the some EMR config fields in project's metadata.yaml file. And then
we'll launch an EMR cluster when you executing the pipeline with
`mage run [project_name] [pipeline]` command. Example EMR config:

## Restart kernel

If your block execution is hanging in the notebook and no block ouput is printed, you can try interrupting the block execution and
restarting the kernel. You can find the "Restart kernel" button in the "Run" menu at the top of the notebook.

## Switching kernels <a name="switching_kernels"></a>

To switch kernels, you first need to follow the steps in the corresponding
section above. Then, you can switch kernels through the kernel selection menu in
the UI.

If you're switching back to the Python3 kernel, you may need to undo the
configuration changes needed for the other kernel types.

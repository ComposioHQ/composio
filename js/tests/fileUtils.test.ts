/**
 * Manual test for file path validation
 * 
 * This file demonstrates the validation we've added to prevent empty file paths.
 * It doesn't attempt to run automated tests since we're working on a fork without 
 * all the dependencies installed.
 */

/*
 * VALIDATION IMPLEMENTED:
 * 
 * 1. In readFileContent (fileUtils.ts):
 * if (!path || path.trim() === '') {
 *   throw new Error('File path cannot be empty');
 * }
 * 
 * 2. In getFileDataAfterUploadingToS3 (fileUtils.ts):
 * if (!path || path.trim() === '') {
 *   throw new Error('File path cannot be empty');
 * }
 * 
 * 3. In processFileUpload (file.ts):
 * const filePath = value as string;
 * if (!filePath || filePath.trim() === '') {
 *   throw new Error('File path cannot be empty');
 * }
 * 
 * These validations will ensure that empty or whitespace-only file paths are caught
 * early with a clear error message, preventing the ENOENT errors that would occur when
 * trying to read empty file paths.

// This is just a placeholder file to document our fix

### Pre-requisites

First, you'll need to enable user authentication within Mage. You can find out more about
this in the [Overview page](/production/authentication/overview).

### Enable Microsoft sign in

There are two ways to enable Microsoft sign in. You can either register an application in your organization's
own Microsoft Entra ID, or use the default Mage application. We recommend registering your own application unless
there is a specific reason you cannot do so.

</Step>

<Step title="Set environment variable for Mage">

Once you have registered your application, you will need to set the following environment variables
in your Mage setup.

| Name | Value |

| `ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_DIRECTORY_ID` | `<tenant_id>` |
| `ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_CLIENT_ID` | `<application_client_id>` |
| `ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_CLIENT_SECRET` | `<application_client_secret>` |

You should now see the "Sign in with Microsoft" button when you start Mage and attempt to sign in.
You may need to restart your Mage server for the changes to take effect.

### Map AD role to Mage role

<Note>

You will need to have created your own application and have app roles in order for this mapping to work.

</Note>

You can map Active Directory roles to Mage roles by setting the `ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_ROLES_MAPPING` environment variable.
The value should be a JSON object with the AD role as the key and the name of the Mage role as the value. For example:

`export ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_ROLES_MAPPING='{"Mage.Edit": "Editor", "Mage.Admin": "Admin"}'`

You can find the AD role value in the App roles section of your application in the Azure Portal.

<Frame>
    <img
        alt="App roles"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/production/authentication/ad-app-role-value.png?raw=true"
    />
</Frame>

When a user signs in for the first time with their Microsoft account, Mage will use this mapping to automatically add
the appropriate roles to the user.

### Set Git directory

The Git directory is the local folder that will be linked to your remote repository.

### Authentication

You will be able to authenticate with GitHub by default, but if you need to authenticate with
GitHub Enterprise (GHE) or other providers, you will need to follow the steps below. You can
authenticate with multiple git providers if you need to. Mage will attempt to use the oauth provider
based on the URL of the remote.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title='Authenticate with GHE'>

<Steps>

<Step title="Register Mage in GHE">

In order for Mage to authenticate with your GHE host, you will need to add Mage as an
authorized oauth application. You can follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
to set it up.

Make sure you copy the client id and client secret after the app is created.

</Step>

<Step title="Update environment variables">

You will need to set the following environment variables in your Mage environment:

1. GHE_HOSTNAME: the hostname of your GHE instance. If you’re using GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you should set this to `github.com`
2. GHE_CLIENT_ID: the client id you retrieved in the previous step
3. GHE_CLIENT_SECRET: the client secret you retrieved in the previous step

</Step>

<Step title="Authenticate with GHE">

You should now be able to authenticate with GHE and follow the rest of the steps in this document.

</Step>

</Steps>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authenticate with BitBucket">

<Steps>

<Step title="Add Mage as an OAuth consumer">

In order for Mage to authenticate with your BitBucket, you will need to add Mage as an
OAuth consumer. You can follow the steps [here](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/)
to set it up.

Make sure you copy the key and secret after the consumer is created.

</Step>

<Step title="Update environment variables">

You will need to set the following environment variables in your Mage environment:

1. BITBUCKET_OAUTH_KEY: the key you retrieved in the previous step
2. BITBUCKET_OAUTH_SECRET: the secret you retrieved in the previous step 

</Step>

<Step title="Authenticate Mage with Bitbucket">

You should now be able to authenticate with Bitbucket and follow the rest of the steps in this document.

</Step>

</Steps>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authenticate with GitLab">

<Note>

Mage will request `read_user`, `write_repository`, and `api` scopes from GitLab in order
to perform the necessary git actions.

</Note>

<Steps>

<Step title="Add Mage Oauth application">

In order for Mage to authenticate with your GitLab, you will need to add a Mage oauth application.
You can follow the steps [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)
to set it up.

Make sure you copy the Application ID and Secret after the oauth app is created.

</Step>

<Step title="Update environment variables">

You will need to set the following environment variables in your Mage environment:

1. GITLAB_CLIENT_ID: the application ID you retrieved in the previous step
2. GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET: the secret you retrieved in the previous step
3. GITLAB_HOST (optional): hostname for your GitLab instance. Defaults to `https://gitlab.com`

</Step>

<Step title="Authenticate Mage with GitLab">

You should now be able to authenticate with GitLab and follow the rest of the steps in this document.

</Step>

</Steps>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Click the Authenticate button next to your Git Provider to start the authentication process.

    <img alt="Authenticate" src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/version-control/authentication.png?raw=true" />
</Frame>

After authorizing Mage, you’ll be redirected back to the initial page and an access token will
be in the URL as a parameter. This access token is saved in your application’s database;
it never leaves your application’s database.

### Add remote

Enter a name for your new remote. For the remote URL, you must use the `https` version of the
GitHub repository (as opposed to the `SSH` version).

For example, the remote URL for Mage is `https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai.git`.

Note that a remote added via HTTPS/SSH authentication _will not_ work— only a remote in the format above is accepted.

Once you fill in both input text fields, click the button labeled <b>Create new remote</b>.

### Actions

#### Clone remote repository

<Warning>

Cloning will copy all the files and folders from the remote repository and put them into the Git directory you specified above.

Cloning won’t automatically create a folder that is named after the remote repository.

For example, if you have a file named `magic.py` in a remote repository named `project_romeo`
then that file will be cloned here `<your git directory>/magic.py`
as opposed to `<your git directory>/project_romeo/magic.py`.

If you want to clone the content of a remote repository into a folder named after the remote repository, then change the Git init directory above to
`<your git directory>/[remote repository name]`

</Warning>

1. Under the Actions dropdown, select the option labeled <b>Clone</b>.
1. Under the Remote dropdown, select the name of the remote you want to clone from (e.g. origin).

1. Under the Actions dropdown, select the option labeled <b>Pull</b>.

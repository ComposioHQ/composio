## Setup

<Note>
We recommend creating your ingress separately from the Mage Helm chart if you are planning
to add your workspaces to the ingress. You can either create the ingress manually through
[the Kubernetes CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
or use [the mageai-ingress Helm chart](https://github.com/mage-ai/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/ingress).
</Note>

We recommend using Helm to set up your Kubernetes cluster. You can find our Mage Helm
documentation [here](/production/deploying-to-cloud/using-helm). You will need to create
a persistent volume for your cluster.

You will need to include your Kubernetes namespace as an environment variable when setting
up your Kubernetes deployment. Here is a sample config for the `values.yaml` file for the
Helm chart:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: mage-fs
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: gke-mage-pvc


env:
  - name: KUBE_NAMESPACE
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  - name: PROJECT_TYPE
    value: main
  - name: MAGE_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL
    value: <database_connection_url>
  - name: REQUIRE_USER_AUTHENTICATION
    value: "1"
```

### Ingress

If you want to access your workspaces through the same url, i.e. `https://your-domain.com/<workspace-name>`,
you will need to set up an ingress.

You will need to first install an ingress controller in your kubernetes cluster if you do not already have one.
The most common ingress controller is the Ingress-Nginx Controller . You
can find instructions on how to install the controller [here](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/).

Once the ingress controller is installed, you can add an ingress to your Kubernetes cluster. If you're
using the mageai-ingress Helm chart, you can add the following configuration to your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: nginx # your ingress class name
  annotations: {}
    # kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    # kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
  hosts:
    - host: your-domain.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```

There is additional configuration for the ingress that you can set, but that will depend on your
own requirements. When a workspace is created, you can specify the name of the ingress created above
to automatically add the workspace to the ingress rules. The workspace will be added to the ingress rules
like this:

```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - host: your-domain.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /<workspace-name>
            path_type: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: <service-name>
                port: 6789
          - path: ...
```


## Permissions

Once your cluster and initial deployment is created, you will also need to give your
Kubernetes service account some permissions in order to create the necessary resources.
You can run the folliwng `kubectl` command to create the `ClusterRole` required for 
managing the Kubernetes resources.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: manage-role
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
      - apps
    resources:
      - nodes
      - persistentvolumeclaims
      - services
      - statefulsets
      - statefulsets/scale
      - ingresses
      - configmaps
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
EOF
```

Once the cluster role is created, you will need to bind the role to the 
service account. You will need to change the service account name if it is not `default`:

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding manage-role-binding \
  --clusterrole=manage-role  \
  --serviceaccount=default:default
```

## Configuration

When creating a new Kubernetes workspace, you can configure the following Kubernetes settings:

<Frame>
    <img
        alt="Kubernetes configuration"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/production/workspaces/workspaces-k8s-settings.png?raw=true"
		/>
</Frame>

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace name | Name of workspace. This name will be used to create all resources for the workspace. |
| Namespace | Kubernetes namespace to create workspace resources. Defaults to the value of the `KUBE_NAMESPACE` environment variable or `default` if empty. |
| Service account name | Kubernetes service account to use to create the resources. Defaults to current pod's service account name. |
| Ingress name | Name of ingress to add the new workspace to. See more information about the ingress set up below. |
| Storage class name | Name of storage class to provision storage from for the stateful set. Defaults to current pvc's storage class name. |
| Storage request size | Amount of storage to provision for the persistent volume claim (in GB). Defaults to current pvc's storage request. |
| Access mode | Access mode for persistent volume claim. [More info in Kubernetes docs.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) Defaults to current pvc's access mode. |
| Retention policy | Retention policy for the stateful set PVC. Defaults to "Retain". |
| Configure container | Customize the configuration for the container. [Configuration options](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/kubernetes/docs/V1Container.md) |

### Lifecycle management

<Note>

Available in version <b>`0.9.41`</b> and greater.

</Note>

Mage provides some support for managing the lifecycle of the workspace. For Kubernetes workspaces, Mage
supports the following lifecycle management options:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Auto termination">

<Note>
When the workspace is stopped, Mage will scale down the stateful set to 0, but all the other resources will still exist. The
workspace can be resumed after being stopped through the UI.
</Note>

<Frame>
    <img
        alt="Auto termination configuration"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/production/workspaces/lifecycle-auto-termination.png?raw=true"
		/>
</Frame>

Mage will automatically stop the workspace after the specified amount of time (max idle time).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pre start script">

<Frame>
    <img
        alt="Auto termination configuration"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/production/workspaces/lifecycle-pre-start.png?raw=true"
		/>
</Frame>

You can select a Python pre start script that will be run before the container is started. The script must
must be a valid Python script with a `get_custom_configs` method that returns a dictionary. The `get_custom_configs`
method will be passed the container config of the workspace as an argument. Here is an example script:

```python
### example_pre_start.py

from typing import Dict

def get_custom_configs(mage_container_config: Dict) -> Dict:
    current_env = config.get('env', [])
    current_env.append({
        'name': 'RANDOM_ENV_VAR',
        'value': 'HI HELLO',
    })
    config['env'] = current_env
    return config
```

This script will add an environment variable to the container config before the container is started. This will be run
when the Kubernetes pod is restarted as well. The returned Dictionary must be a valid Kubernetes container config. You
can find the schema for a container config [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/kubernetes/docs/V1Container.md)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Post start hook">

<Frame>
    <img
        alt="Auto termination configuration"
        src="https://github.com/mage-ai/assets/blob/main/production/workspaces/lifecycle-post-start.png?raw=true"
		/>
</Frame>

You can also configure a post start hook that will be run after the container is started. This setting leverages the 
native Kubernetes container lifecycle [PostStart hook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/attach-handler-lifecycle-event/).
Mage provides two configuration fields:

1. `Command`: corresponds to the Kubernetes `lifecycle.postStart.exec.command` field. This field is required if you are
using a post start hook. This can be a string command or a list.
2. `Path to hook`: Mage will mount the file specified by this setting to the container. You can reference this fild in your
post start `command` to perform more advanced operations. The path of this file will be `/app/<file_name>` in the container.

Example:
```
Command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/example_post_start.sh"]
Path to hook: /home/src/my_mage_project/example_post_start.sh
```

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Ingress

When an ingress is provided, the `MAGE_BASE_PATH` environment variable will be set automatically 
to the name of the workspace. Thus, the workspace will be accessible at the `/<workspace-name>` path.

Providing an ingress name will add the workspace to the ingress rules like this:

```
spec:
  rules:
    - host: "your host"
      http:
        paths:
          ...
          - path: /<workspace-name>
            path_type: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: <service-name>
                port: 6789
```

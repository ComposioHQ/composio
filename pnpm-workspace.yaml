  # According to https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/issues/8468, v3.25.75 is broken. v3.25.76 is probably broken as well,
  # as it causes "error TS2589: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite." in `./ts/packages/providers/langchain/src/index.ts`.
  # However, most packages imported elsewhere (e.g., ´@ai-sdk/*`) require `zod: ^3.25.76 || ^4`.
  # Hence, we have to use at least v3.25.76 for now, and "accept" and ignore the above TS2589 error in `@composio/langchain`.

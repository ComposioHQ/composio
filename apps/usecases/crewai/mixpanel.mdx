## Connecting CrewAI with Mixpanel
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Mixpanel

Mixpanel is an analytics platform that helps companies measure user engagement and retention.

### Integrating Mixpanel with CrewAI

Integrating Mixpanel & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Tracking user engagement metrics
2. Analyzing retention data
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Mixpanel
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Mixpanel App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Mixpanel
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add mixpanel # One line to authenticate, configure and add Mixpanel integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions mixpanel "Tracking user engagement metrics" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Mixpanel CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Mixpanel
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Mixpanel
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.MIXPANEL]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Mixpanel API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Tracking user engagement metrics"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Mixpanel Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Mixpanel using Mixpanel APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Mixpanel on users behalf. You need to take action on Mixpanel using Mixpanel APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_mixpanel = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.MIXPANEL_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_mixpanel = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.MIXPANEL])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_mixpanel = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.MIXPANEL], tags=[Tag.MIXPANEL_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>

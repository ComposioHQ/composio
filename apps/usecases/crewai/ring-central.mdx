## Connecting CrewAI with RingCentral
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of RingCentral

RingCentral provides cloud-based communication and collaboration solutions for businesses.

### Integrating RingCentral with CrewAI

Integrating RingCentral & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Handling customer support queries
2. Creating new communication channels
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with RingCentral
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the RingCentral App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising RingCentral
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add ring-central # One line to authenticate, configure and add RingCentral integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions ring-central "Handling customer support queries" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all RingCentral CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For RingCentral
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for RingCentral
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.RING-CENTRAL]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform RingCentral API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Handling customer support queries"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='RingCentral Agent',
    goal="""You take action on RingCentral using RingCentral APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on RingCentral on users behalf. You need to take action on RingCentral using RingCentral APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_ring-central = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.RING-CENTRAL_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_ring-central = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.RING-CENTRAL])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_ring-central = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.RING-CENTRAL], tags=[Tag.RING-CENTRAL_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>

## Connecting CrewAI with Highlevel

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Highlevel

Highlevel is a messaging platform that allows businesses to communicate with prospective and existing customers within their app, on their website, through social media, or via email.

### Integrating Highlevel with CrewAI

Integrating Highlevel & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. communicating with customers via messaging within their app or website
2. engaging with customers through social media or email
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Highlevel

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Highlevel App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Highlevel
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add highlevel # One line to authenticate, configure and add Highlevel integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions highlevel "communicating with customers via messaging within their app or website" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Highlevel CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Highlevel
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Highlevel
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.HIGHLEVEL]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Highlevel API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "communicating with customers via messaging within their app or website"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Highlevel Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Highlevel using Highlevel APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Highlevel on users behalf. You need to take action on Highlevel using Highlevel APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_highlevel = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.HIGHLEVEL_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_highlevel = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.HIGHLEVEL])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_highlevel = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.HIGHLEVEL], tags=[Tag.HIGHLEVEL_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>

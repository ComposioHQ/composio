# Scheduling Agent Guide

This guide provides detailed steps to create a Scheduler Agent that leverages Composio and Agentic frameworks such as CrewAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AG2 (Formerly AutoGen) and ChatGPT to schedule your events based on received emails. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

## Steps to Run

**Navigate to the Project Directory:**
Change to the directory where the `setup.sh`, `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md` files are located. For example:
```sh
cd path/to/project/directory
```

### 1. Run the Setup File
Make the setup.sh Script Executable (if necessary):
On Linux or macOS, you might need to make the setup.sh script executable:
```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
```
Execute the setup.sh script to set up the environment and install dependencies:
```shell
./setup.sh
```
Now, fill in the `.env` file with your secrets.

### 2. Run the Python Script
```shell
python python/examples/advanced_agents/scheduler_agent/scheduler_agent_autogen/main.py
```

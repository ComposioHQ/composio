# PR Agent Guide

This guide provides detailed steps to create a PR agent that leverages Composio, agentic frameworks such as Langchain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AG2 (Formerly AutoGen), OpenAI and ChatGPT to review PRs every time they're created. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

## Steps to perform before running

Ensure you have triggers enabled in the Composio Dashboard. These are the triggers to enable:
1. [Github Pull Request Event (trigger_id = GITHUB_PULL_REQUEST_EVENT)](https://app.composio.dev/trigger/github_pull_request_event?page=1)

Add the slackbot to general channel in your workspace to use it.

## Steps to Run

**Navigate to the Project Directory:**
Change to the directory where the `setup.sh`, `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md` files are located. For example:
```sh
cd path/to/project/directory
```

### 1. Run the Setup File
Make the setup.sh Script Executable (if necessary):
On Linux or macOS, you might need to make the setup.sh script executable:
```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
```
Execute the setup.sh script to set up the environment and install dependencies:
```shell
./setup.sh
```
Now, fill in the `.env` file with your secrets.

### 2. Run the Python Script
```shell
python cookbook/examples/pr_agent_openai/main.py
```

    Provide a detailed evaluation including:
    1. Loan eligibility (Yes/No)
    2. Risk assessment
    3. Recommended loan terms if eligible
    4. Industry-specific insights
    5. Decide if the plan is approved or not, depending on that create a Detailed 30-50 day actionable plan in Google Docs:
       - If approved: Create a structured repayment strategy that optimizes cash flow
       - If not approved: Outline specific steps to improve the application for approval
       
    For the action plan, include:
    - Week-by-week breakdown of tasks
    - Specific metrics to track
    - Potential challenges and solutions
    - Resources needed
    My output should contain all the detailed analysis and also create the initial google doc using the tools available to you and provide the link to it.

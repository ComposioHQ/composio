Set up the [Nango CLI](/understand/concepts/scripts#the-nango-cli) and an [integration folder](/understand/concepts/scripts#integration-folder) to develop custom integrations with Nango.

# Install the Nango CLI

Install the Nango CLI globally: 
```bash
npm install -g nango
```

# Create your Nango integrations folder

All your integrations live in a folder called `nango-integrations`. Whether located in your main codebase or a dedicated repository, this folder should be version-controlled.

To initialize your integrations folder (e.g. at the root of your repository), run:
```bash
nango init # Creates `./nango-integrations` folder with some initial configuration
```

# Authenticate the CLI

In an `.env` file in `./nango-integrations`, add the following environment variables:
```bash
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_PROD='<PROD-SECRET-KEY>'
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_DEV='<DEV-SECRET-KEY>'
```

Get your secret keys from the _Environment Settings_ tab (toggle between the `Production` and `Development` environment in the left nav bar).

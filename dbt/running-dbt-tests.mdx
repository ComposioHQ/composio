You can write tests for your dbt models by following
[dbt’s documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/tests).

When a pipeline runs, each dbt model block will run and then each test
associated with that dbt model will be ran.

For example, if you add a dbt block to your pipeline for a dbt model named
`my_third_dbt_model` and a test file named `test_my_third_dbt_model.sql` with
the following folder structure:

```
demo_project/
|   dbt/
|   |   demo/
|   |   |   models/
|   |   |   |   example/
|   |   |   |   |   my_third_dbt_model.sql
|   |   |   tests/
|   |   |   |   example/
|   |   |   |   |   test_my_third_dbt_model.sql
```

Then whenever your pipeline runs, the test in `test_my_third_dbt_model.sql`
will also be ran after the dbt run for the model `my_third_dbt_model` is
complete.

Any errors in the dbt test will also fail the pipeline run. The output of the
test will be logged and viewable when inspecting the pipeline’s run and logs.

## Folder and file naming conventions

In your tests folder, you must mirror the path of the model you want to test.

For example, if your model is named `my_third_dbt_model` and if its located
under the folder named `example`, then your test file must be located here:

```
models/example/my_third_dbt_model.sql
```

```
tests/example/my_third_dbt_model.sql
```

Note that the model file and test file have the same name (e.g.
`my_third_dbt_model.sql`) and are nested under a folder with identical names
(e.g. `example`).

---

## Example

The content of the dbt model named `my_third_dbt_model` is:

```sql
SELECT 1 AS n_constant_number
```

### Failed test

The content of the test for `my_third_dbt_model.sql` that will cause a test
failure is:

```sql
SELECT n_constant_number
FROM {{ ref('my_third_dbt_model') }}
GROUP BY n_constant_number
HAVING (n_constant_number = 1)
```

Here is the sample output of a failed test for the above files:

### Successful test

The content of the test for `my_third_dbt_model.sql` that will yield a passing
test is:

```sql
SELECT n_constant_number
FROM {{ ref('my_third_dbt_model') }}
GROUP BY n_constant_number
HAVING (n_constant_number = 0)
```

Here is the sample output of a successful test for the above files:

```
